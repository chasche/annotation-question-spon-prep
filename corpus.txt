*open-ended interview*
HV1: We are interested in knowing what you and Child S, the third-grade girl, do in your daily routines.
Please tell me what Child S does from the moment she wakes up until she goes to bed.
PAR: Like what?
HV1: Do you want me to repeat the question?
PAR: Yes, please, I didn’t understand.
[0:09:00]
HV1: We are interested in knowing what you and Child S do in your daily routine. Please tell me about a
typical day of Child S from the moment she wakes up until she goes to bed.
PAR: Like what she does?
HV1: Uh-huh. Like a typical day. Her routine. Uh-huh.
PAR: Uh, she wakes up. She goes to the bathroom, either to take a bath or get ready for school, and
goes to school. [0:09:32] When she comes back, when she gets home, the first thing she does is her
homework. After doing her homework she sits to have dinner, eats, takes a bath, reads, and watches
some TV. And after TV, she goes to the bathroom, brushes her teeth and gets ready to go to bed.
HV1: Very good.
PAR: She likes to take her bath in the morning.
[0:10:00]
HV1: We are interested in learning more about your children’s books and their reading interests. Child S
is showing (Home Visitor) some books. Where did Child S get her most of her books?
PAR: Most of the books she has now she brought them from the school’s library.
[0:10:29]
HV1: Okay. From any other place?
PAR: I buy them for him.
HV1: Okay. What are some of the things you do to make Child S a great reader?
PAR: Um, I ask her questions. She loves the ones about animals, Nature and things like that. I ask her
questions, [0:10:59] for example, what does a volcano do? Why does it erupt? Why ? When I as her, she
gets interested in what is going on, and she reads.
HV1: Okay. Do you do something special to help her learn new words?
PAR: Um, I make her choose the words she doesn’t understand. I help her to look up what they mean
[0:11:35]

HV1: Uh-huh.
PAR: I make her make sentences with the words.
HV1: Do you do something special to help her find time to read?
[0:12:05]
PAR: Um, yes. I tell her if she sits to read, if she can do it for half an hour, I reward her with something,
so she reads. I reward her.
HV1: Um, so that is one of the ways you motivate her?
PAR: Yes. She always has a book, and I tell her, “If you finish this book and you tell me what it is about,
you will have a reward, a prize”. [0:12:38] And then she hurries on reading.

HV1: What are some of the questions you ask Child S about the books she reads?
PAR: First, the title. The book’s title. And why did she choose that book. Um, who is the principal
character; the character, and what does he do. Or what is it about and what is that character doing, and
how it ends.
[0:13:15]
HV1: What do you do, if anything, when Child S has difficulties reading a book?
PAR: I sit with her and help her with the pronunciation or to understand the words. We write down the
words she doesn’t understand, we look up their meaning, I make her make sentences, and when she
understands that word, I get her back to reading, but now she understands.
[0:13:49]
HV1: Is there anyone here at home that can help her read?
PAR: No.
HV1: Okay. When do you know that Child S has done a good job reading?
PAR: Because she gives me a good narration of the reading, well, she narrates it from the beginning to
the end what it was about.
HV1: How would you describe Child S’ reading abilities?
[0:14:26]
PAR: Mm… how can I say it? She has problems. She is not very good. She had problems. She got
confused between Spanish and English. That is her problem, that she has… There are words she knows
in Spanish and there are words she knows in English. She tells me, “I don’t know this in English, how do
you say it in Spanish”? She has to be translating between English and Spanish. [0:15:02] She is not very
good because she can’t speak well.
HV1: What are your goals for Child S’ reading during this summer?

PAR: My goal is, well, first of all work with her, because the goal we both have is for her to learn to read
both in Spanish and English. For her to differentiate which one is Spanish and which one is English. That
is my goal for her.
[0:15:32]
HV1: Anything else?
HV1: N Well, in regards to reading, that’s it, for her to know how to speak… learn good Spanish. Read
and write.
(long silence)
[0:16:04]
HV1: you told me a little while ago that you reward her when she finishes a book. In what other ways do
you motivate her… to ?
PAR: Going out. If she
HV1: Is that the reward, or the other way?
PAR: That is another way to reward her. That is a way.
HV1: Reward would be a thing.
PAR: Like a thing, a toy, a doll, dolls is what she likes the most (laughter). She has quite a few in her
bedroom. [0:16:32] Those are her rewards. She has been collecting dolls, but the other way is, if you do
this, we will go to the park, and we will go to play, and we will go and do that. That is another thing that
motivates her, to bring her friends to the park.
HV1: Very good. [0:16:59] Besides the things you have told me, do you do other things to help her
understand what she reads?
PAR: Playing. Playing, like um, like… how do you say when… like the word “hop”, “hop”.
HV1: Hop, jump.
PAR: Uh-huh. I tell her… It’s just that I don’t know how you say this, what does it mean… Okay, I
[0:17:31]
HV1: She asks you that?
PAR: She asks me that, I start like hopping.
HV1: Ah, you act it out so she understands it.
PAR: Ah-hah, like acting, and she understands it, I don’t have to tell her what it means, she can figure
out what it means.
HV1: She gets it.
PAR: She gets it. Uh-huh.

[0:18:00]
HV1: (to HV2) Child S is reading at this point?
HV2: Yeah.
HV1: Okay.
(rustling papers)
HV1: Very good. That was the second part of the interview. So, as soon as Child S is done… is done with
the article she is reading, all four of us will gather to have her here. [0:18:31]
PAR: Yes.
HV1: Okay. So this is for you to keep, this too.
(rustling papers, background conversation between HV2 and CHI)
[0:19:42]
HV1: So you finished reading, right?
CHI: Yes.
HV1: Well, the last part of the activity will last for about fifteen minutes, and it is about the activity we
will be doing together, and it is the activity that Child S and you will be doing during summer.

*other excerpts from home visit*
How many nights does Child S read before bedtime?
PAR: Um, well, when I was working I didn’t make her read. About two weeks ago I started making her
read every night. I make her read every night.


01-ASW
*open-ended interview*

*HV1: Okay. So first question, we’re interested in knowing the kinds of things that you and Child R do
in a typical day. So if you were to think about what a day looks for her from the time she gets up to the
time she goes to bed, can you kind of walk me through that?

*PAR: Is it for school or just any other time?

*HV1: We could start with a school day.

*PAR: Okay. The typical school day she gets up about 6:00 to get dressed, usually have breakfast
about 7:00, 7:30, out the door 8:30. When she comes home – when I pick them up at 3:30, when she
comes home we do homework for about an hour and half, and then she’s left with her dad or her older
sister, and she’s normally either reading or playing games on – educational games on the computer,
‘cause I’m usually gone to work by 6:00. So that’s our typical school weekday.

*HV1: Okay. And then what happens after reading or computer? I know you’re not here, but –

*PAR: She is normally in the bed by 8:30, 9:00, so.

*HV1: Okay, okay. And then – I’m sorry, I interrupted you.

*PAR: Oh, no, that’s okay.

*HV1: You were talking about another –

*PAR: Oh, oh. And then normally on the weekends she’s usually – weekends are usually activities with
us. We might go out shopping or just go out to the park, or maybe go catch a movie or something like
that.

*HV1: Okay, great. Thank you. And we’re interested in learning more about her books and her
reading interests, and she’ll be showing (Home Visitor) her books in a few minutes. But our question for
you, where did you get most of her books from?

*PAR: She recently got some books from the school library. So she normally gets them from the school
library, or we’ll go to the County Library and pick out books.

*HV1: Okay, great.

*PAR: So the majority of the time it’s the Lincoln – the public library.

*HV1: I love to hear that you actually utilize that. So many people don’t, and it’s such a cool – I mean,
it’s an awesome resource.

*PAR: It is.

*HV1: Do you go to the downtown location?

*PAR: The one right here in 98, the _______ location.

*HV1: There – I didn’t know there was – hmm, that’s nice. And what are some things that you do to
help Child R become a good reader?

*PAR: Read with her as she’s reading, and if she needs help with words then I’ll let her try to
pronounce them before I go ahead – instead of just giving her the word I make her try to pronounce it to
me, and then if not then I’ll assist her in sounding it out.

*HV1: Okay, great. Okay. And what if anything do you do when you see that she’s having a hard time
with a book?

*PAR: If she’s having a hard time with a book we normally – I’ll let her walk away for maybe about a
minute or so and come back, and then if she’s still having trouble we might move on to another book
and just come back to that book another day.

*HV1: Okay. And five, what are some questions that you ask her when you talk about books that she’s
read?

*PAR: I ask her about the main character, what happened in the book, what does she think the main
idea of the book was, and why does she think the character did what they did or didn’t do depending on
what type of book it is.

*HV1: Okay, great. And number six, what if anything do you do to motivate her to read?

*PAR: To motivate her to read? (Laughter) I let her know that if – you know, you have to keep up with
reading because that’s all you’re gonna test on. In school the majority of schoolwork is reading, so if you
don’t improve your reading then you’re gonna have a hard time in class, and I’m not there to help you
so you’ve got to keep going with it.

*HV1: Okay, great. And are there other people in the home that help her with reading?

*PAR: Her dad and her older sister.

*HV1: Okay. And do you know specifically what they do to help?

*PAR: No, I don’t.

*HV1: Okay. I know it’s kind of a hard question. Okay. Eight, how do you know if your child has done
a good job of reading a book?

*PAR: If she has done a good job of reading the book – based off the answers that she gives. If all the
answers are correct and we don’t have to go back and look for the answer, then I know that she
understood what she was reading and remembering it and taking it in.

*HV1: And are these answers to your question or to like school-based questions?

*PAR: Both, school-based and my own questions that I come up with.

*HV1: Okay, great. And what do you think makes a good third-grade reader? What should they be
able to do?

*PAR: I’d say in the third grade they should be able to pronounce – I want to say maybe – maybe 80
percent – no, maybe 85 to 90 percent of the words they should be able to pronounce themselves, just
based off a third-grade level and based off the – you know how the books have the type of levels and all
that? So based on the level type of books, if they could pronounce all the words without any assistance,
then that makes them a good reader.

*HV1: Okay. And how would you describe Child R’s reading skills?

*PAR: She’s – to me I think she’s below where she needs to be, because she has to – she goes to a
reading specialist at school so that’s helping her, but I see her as below where she needs to be.

*HV1: Okay. And last question for you, what goals do you have for her reading this summer?

*PAR: Hopefully to improve where she can basically read the book without getting frustrated or read
the book to understand and comprehend what’s actually going on without having to go back and look in
the paragraph for an answer.

*HV1: Okay, great. Thank you.

*PAR: You’re welcome.

*HV1: And the child portion always takes longer than the parent portion –

*PAR: Oh, that’s fine.


01-AVP
*HV1: That was the first part of the conversation. The next one I have a sheet like that with the
questions and answers. It's going to be really open-ended questions -- again there's no right or wrong
answer; I'm not expecting you to say anything special and I'm not going to be writing anything actually
this time. So we're interested in knowing the kinds of things that you and Child J do in your everyday
routines. Tell me what you do every day for Child J from morning to bedtime as well as you can
remember.

*PAR:
Okay he have a book under there as well if he looking for one. But he gets up in
the morning, he gets his chores done before he go to school, he do the typical brush his teeth, wash his
face. He go to school, he leave about 8:15, gets home about 3:55. He give me all his homework. He get
his homework together. I usually let him do his homework; if he have questions he'll come to me and
ask me. Then if some problem's wrong we'll go over it and correct his mistakes. He'll take a shower,
he'll read, he eats dinner, it's time for bed.

*HV1: A busy day. We're also interested in learning more about Child J's books and reading interests.
Child J's showing her some books right now; where did he get most of the books from?

*PAR:

I think he still have two from last summer through the reading program.

*HV1: You say the same reading program as this one?

*PAR:
No, it was another one. It was a reading program that they gave to the kids at
school who frequent the library often. And yeah, but I think most of them were bulk from the stores,
_____, "I like this one," and I'll go, make sure it's able for him to read and then he'll get it.

*HV1: When you say stores, you bought books for him?

*PAR:

Mhm.

*HV1: And what are some of the things that you do to help him be a good reader?

*PAR:
Sound out his words, not rely on the pictures as much because if it's a picture
book he'll look at the pictures instead of try to sound out the words. So I didn't tell him how cover the

syllables to sound them out if the word it too big and he's getting intimidated because it's too big, kind
of like cover some of the words to sound out all of the letters. So he won't look at all of the letters and
try to jumble them all together. Just like parent I tell him to cover all of it except the P and pronounce
the P and slide down to the A and go from there. I'll try to like cover the pictures if it's a picture book so
he won't focus on the picture; he'll focus on the words. And basically just try to slow down and sound
out the word.

*HV1: Do you do anything for him to make time for reading?

*PAR:
I do. I limit how much he watch TV and tell him, "You can't watch TV until you
read this and tell me what happened," who is in it and things like that. If he can't do that then I'll pick
another book say read this one. So my main thing is limiting his TV watching until he gets the book out
of the way.

*HV1: What if anything do you do to help him understand what he reads?

*PAR:

Hmm?

*HV1: What are some of the things that you do to help him understand what he reads?

*PAR:
If it's not a picture then I'll let him read it and then I'll ask him, "Did you
understand what you just read?" And if he say no I'll break it down like what this happened, what that
happened, and then this is what happened, why that happened. I kind of like break the story down to
him if it's not explained in the picture so he won't be lost in the story.

*HV1: What if anything do you do to help him learn the meanings of new words?

*PAR:
One, do he understand the word. If he say no then I'll give him an example, like
if he didn't know what -- trying to think of something -- if he didn't know what a candle wax was and I
asked him do you know what candle wax is he'll say no and I'll break it down to him, "Well candle wax is
what they make candles out of." And he ______, say, "Okay," and then we'll read some more and I'll go
back and ask him, "Well do you know what candle wax is?" And he like, "Yeah, that's what they make
candles out of," to make sure it stuck.

*HV1: What if anything do you do when your child has a hard time with a book?

*PAR:
For one I ask him what ______ he go through the books but he get to the point
where he, "I'm done," but I ______ like reading along so I hear when he starting to hit that stumbling
block, or something like that and I ask him I'll be like, "Hold on, are you having problems?" He be like,
"Yes," I be like, "Okay, what are you having problems with?" And he'll point to it and I'll be like, "Okay,
read it to me and read it to me slow," and if he gets stuck like that then that's when I step in and be like,
"Okay we gonna sit and break this down and go from there."

*HV1: What are some of the questions that you ask him when you talk about books that he has read?

*PAR:
Who were characters in the books? What took place at the beginning of the
book? What took place in the middle of the book? How did I end? Why did that person do this? Who
was it by? Things like that.

*HV1: What if anything do you do to motivate him to read?

*PAR:
It'll be where on the weekends -- well it's like with all the kids on the weekend if
they do good the whole week then it'd be like this is a weekend, it's Saturday, we gonna go do
something. It's like an incentive to do it, or either it'd be like if he got a hard book on Monday and it
took him to Wednesday to get through it then I know he struggle with it but he got through it with no,
not getting upset or whatever then okay, we go get ice cream because you know you did it, didn't give
up, didn't get discouraged then we'll go get ice cream or whatever.

*HV1: Are there other people here that help him with reading?

*PAR:

Mhm.

*HV1: And who is that?

*PAR:

He has two older sisters and an older brother.

*HV1: How old are they, the sisters?

*PAR:

One sister's 15, the other sister's 12 and the older brother's 12.

*HV1: So he's the youngest one out of the four?

*PAR:

Yeah.

*HV1: Do you know what they do to help him?

*PAR:
His other brother put him -- he'll give him ____ books like the Spider Man books
and all this and that will grab his attention then I've heard him say, "Well just imagine you're Spider
Man? What would you do?" Thing like that. He'll sit there and help him read and he'll be like, "I don't
understand it" and I hear him explaining to him, "Well, this is what Spider Man do" and things like that.
Same thing with the girls, they do the same thing too.

*HV1: How do you know if Child J's has done a good job reading a book?

*PAR:
Because he can get done with it quick and he'll have like a big smile on his face
like, "I did it" without messing up the words or anything. But his whole facial expression shows it, like
from probably mid-book to the end he'll be like, "Yes, I did it."

*HV1: What do you think makes a good third grad reader?

*PAR:
Determination. No matter how hard the book is if you have determination you
won't give up on it. I just feel that makes any type of reader -- excuse me --

[Off mic conversation]

*HV1: How would you describe his reading skills?

*PAR:
He still struggles with a lot, especially if he gets nervous or he gets discouraged
but he still struggles with reading.

*HV1: Anything else?

*PAR:

Mm-mm.

*HV1: What roles do you have for Child J's reading this summer?

*PAR:
To possible get him back on grade level with his reading because I'm not exactly
sure when he's hear with me and he's reading he's reading, he'll have his stumbles but he'll get back on
it. But when he's in school it's like a totally different thing. He's having difficulty reading so I'm not
exactly sure why.

*HV1: After he comes back to school in the fall?

*PAR:
Not even that. It's like when he does his homework here he'll sit and read and
he'll stumble over a couple words but he'll pick himself back up. But when he goes to school the next
day and they pull him out for reading it's like he have more problems, he stumbles a lot more and I'm
not exactly sure that's the difference between here and there.

*HV1: That's everything as far as ______ and his reading. Are you guys ready? Oh really, good timing.
Thank you. What's Child J's date of birth?


01-AGD
*open-ended interview*
*HV1: No, not at all. But they’re more open-ended. And again, there’s no wrong or right answer. And
I might write things down, but just do for me, too, myself. So we’re interested in knowing the kinds of
things that you and he do in your everyday routines. Tell me about a typical day for Child J –
*PAR: Child J.
*HV1: -- Child J from morning to bedtime as well as you can remember.
*PAR: Get up, watch cartoons. I probably get up and cook breakfast, and they take a bath, put their
clothes on. We still sitting around looking at TV. If he ain’t decide to color or pay the Wii, then when
they start getting restless, I say, “Y’all need to go outside.” He might go out there with his friends and
play. Then we probably go over they Grandma house and we have a cookout or something. This the
weekend.
On Monday, you know, they in school. And then we come back home. He’ll get back in his cartoons or
go in the room, watch – read a book or color. About the same thing because they don’t really go outside
and play, so my kids are housebound kids. They rarely go outside, so everything activity always consist
in the house.
*HV1: Okay.
*PAR: You go outside a little more now. You stay in the house more than you go outside, don’t you?
*HV1: Well, _____ interested _____ more about your – about his – your child’s books and reading
interests. Child J’s showing (Home Visitor) some books right now.
*PAR: Mm-hmm.
*HV1: Where did he get most of his books?
*PAR: From school, libraries –
*HV1: School libraries?
*PAR: Mm-hmm. Most of ‘em basically be coming like from school or like when he done did
something good he might get two or three free books during the year.
*HV1: From the school?
*PAR: Mm-hmm.
*HV1: Okay.
*PAR: So that’s where they basically come from – or the library. So either/or. And then his brother –
one of his oldest brothers not here, so he constantly send him books and crayons and stuff like that. So
– he just got that stack of crayons and stuff from his brother. He in training school, so he send little stuff
that his age. He send it home to him. So he been getting mad books from him, so he just got like three
new books from his brother and crayons and stuff like that. So from everybody – the family.

*HV1: Okay. What are some of the things that you do to help him become a better reader or a good
reader?
*PAR: Read with him. I mean, I don’t really –
*HV1: Reading with him.
*PAR: Yeah – and then sometimes I don’t even have to do that. I mean, like, he just so smart – it like
once he got it, he just got it, and it just went from there. Like, I barely have to help him with his
homework. Like, I sit there and make sure he do it right. Before I said, I don’t have to help him read it
because he don’t want me to help him read it. So he kinda like a little man on his own, like, “I got this,
Ma. I don’t need your help.”
“Well, I just wanna make sure you do it right.” “But I got it, Ma. I read it myself.” So it’s like me just like
this, “Okay, just tell me what you read, and I wanna see you reading it right,” and that’s it. So that’s
what we do, and I’m ______ very smart. Let me get some of his report cards. That boy got – I don’t
know what – everybody be asking me, “What did you do? That kids is so smart.” Like, “I really don’t
know. I really _________.” First, second and third semester –
*HV1: And –
*PAR: See his reading – you see what she said?
*HV1: Wow! Second quarter reading level exceeds –
*PAR: Over!
*HV1: -- exceeds third grade levels. Wow!
*PAR: He was exceeding it in second semester.
*HV1: What are the 3 here?
*PAR: 3’s – that’s A. That’s a B. That’s a B. That’s a A. What’s that? An A, a B, an A.
*HV1: Oh, I see. I see that. Oh, wow! Mathematics –
*PAR: Mm-hmm – B, and I think that was a C, but then a B, then it went back up.
*HV1: The social studies and science.
*PAR: B, B – mm-hmm.
*HV1: Okay. Prefer English language. Arts he got 91 and then 88 and then 86 and 3 – all 3 and 4.
*PAR: Mm-hmm – all 3’s – you know, 3’s is actually B’s, but I don’t know how they do it –
*HV1: 3 means performs at grade level. Most of the time he got 3 or 4 for reading in all of the
quarters. Okay. Wow! I’m impressed. Do you do anything to help him make time for reading?
*PAR: Well, really with Child J, I don’t have to. Child J just love to read, so it’s never like you have to
make time for him. You know what I’m saying? It’s just like – I have to get on more of my middle son to
read more than him. See, if I start getting on him and say, “You need to go back there and read a book,”

he gonna go run and go get a book and start reading. You see what I’m saying? So it’s never – it’s more
me getting on my other one, and then he just go on and do it.
*HV1: He’s the brother.
*PAR: Yeah. Yeah – he’s middle brother – yeah.
*HV1: Middle brother – okay.
*PAR: But that’s the one I’m more hard on. I don’t really have to be so hard on him because he like
right here.
*HV1: Yeah, everybody’s different.
*PAR: You see what I’m saying? So that one I’m more hard on. So it’s just like when I do say
something to him, he’ll move more quicker to do it. And he’ll be like, “Well, you need to be doing this.
See, I’m sitting here reading a book. Why you can’t read a book?” So it’s basically him being the older
brother than him being the older brother.
*HV1: He’s more mature in that sense.
*PAR: Yeah, really – really – he really is. He got a phone, but my middle boy don’t have a phone. He
done lost his, but he still got his. He don’t take it to school. He set it on his table. When he get outta
school, he gets it. When he go over to his little friend house, he calls and let me know where he at. This
is what a eight-year-old do. He done had that phone four months and has not lost it.
I done bought him four or five phones, so that tells you how mature he is then. You know how they say
all your kids are different? It really shows that.
*HV1: What, if anything, do you do to help him learn the meanings of new words?
*PAR: He loves some big words. I don’t know. I can’t answer that question. I don’t know. That I can’t
answer. I mean, some big words I don’t even have to teach him how to understand them. He know
how to just sound them out. Like some stuff, I didn’t – like he – at the age of five or six when the news
came on and when the storms come up, you know, the _____ radar – blah, blah, blah, blah, blah – he
read it all.
So I’m looking like – and he knew the big words and all, so it was like nothing I couldn’t say. I was like,
“Well, dang! Seems like he might be a little smarter than I am!” So I don’t know. I can’t answer that
question. He just so – he just really – I’m telling you, he’s smart.
*HV1: And what do you, if anything – what do you do when he has a hard time with a book?
*PAR: Oh, I help him. If I don’t understand it, his daddy help him. I don’t understand it, Grandma help
him. And Grandma, she still – she went back at school, so it’s like everybody in my house kinda like in
school. So sometimes they all get together at the table – well, two of my children _______ where
everybody get at the table, and Grandma be doing her stuff, and them two be doing their stuff. So we
all just help each other.
So it’s like a family – it’s all of us working together to help them. So when something get hard, if I can’t
help him with it and don’t understand it he goes to Grandma and his dad, and all of us stay here.

*HV1: All of you guys live here?
*PAR: Yeah.
*HV1: Okay.
*PAR: Daddy out there on the patio now, and Grandma, I guess she just went to the room back there.
*HV1: And what are some of the questions that you ask him when you guys talk about books that he
reads?
*PAR: How did he like the book? What was the most exciting part of the book? Who was the
character in the book? Basically the stuff that they ask you on – in your tests, and so that would be the
main things I ask him when he done read it. What did he like? What was the ending part? What did –
say if it was a girl, well, what did the girl have to do in the book? You know – same stuff as when we
went in school.
*HV1: And what do you do to motivate him to read?
*PAR: I don’t have to do nothing. I mean, I can’t even __________ I don’t have to do nothing. I could
just sit in here and say, “Well, I think y’all need to read a book,” and he’ll just go read a book. It’s like – I
don’t have to hassle him. It’s not, “I’m tired of reading books.” It’s none of that. So I try to keep him
that way so it never get boring and tiring to him. So as far as that, nothing.
He love to read. He love to color. He love to play his Wii. So that’s just some of the _____ things, and
then we don’t do nothing too much nothing else. So them are like some of the fun activities being here.
So that’s what it is.
*HV1: You already mentioned there’s dad and the grandma who sometimes help him with reading. Is
there any other person that helps him –
*PAR: His brothers or his whole – well, he’s got two brothers.
*HV1: Age –
*PAR: 16 and the middle one’s gonna be 14.
*HV1: And what do they do to help him – I mean, the brothers and Grandma and –
*PAR: Every –
*HV1: Do you know ___________ things they do – I mean, Grandma, Dad, brothers?
*PAR: Well, when his brothers read with him – my oldest son, he read with him more than my middle
son. Him and my middle son, they get more in attitudes with each other, so he don’t care to read with
him. But my oldest son, they’ll go back there in the room. They’ll lay on the bed, and they just get in
their own world of reading, and they just be back there reading. Now, that middle one come in here,
and I say, “Y’all go back there and read a book,” they be back there arguing because Child J feel like he
over-reading over him.
“Oh, I can’t hear. You talking louder than me, and we both trying to read at the same time,” so they
don’t click when it’s time to read. He makes it more not being fun when it’s come down to reading.

*HV1: How do you know when he’s done a good job reading a book?
*PAR: Say it again.
*HV1: How do you know whether he has done a good job reading a book?
*PAR: When he come – yeah, when he come in and tell us that – the smiles on his face tell you when
he read a good book, or he’ll come in, “Ma, I like this book.” Like, what’s that book _______ brought
from – Twilights, wasn’t it?
*CHI:

No, it was Benjamin Franklin.

*PAR: You liked that, right?
*HV1: Which one?
*PAR: Benjamin Franklin? Benjamin Franklin.
*HV1: It’s a book by – it’s a story about Benjamin –
*PAR: Benjamin – yeah – and he sat here and read the whole book because he had a test – get your
feet off my chair. He had to do a poster and all that. So he was mad that I had made him read most of
the whole majority of the book. But in the end, he liked it, because I’m like – you know how Benjamin
Franklin – it has a reading part of the book, and then each little section up there at the top it tells what
he did in that year. So –
*HV1: ______ ___ __________-- what’s the name of that book?
*PAR: That’s Benjamin Franklin – the real Benjamin Franklin.
*HV1: I know, but he – he brought in his _____________ _______. I don’t know.
*PAR: I don’t know what book it was. But it was just – it was his whole life story – how many kids he
have, what did he do, what else did he do besides electricity and all that. So he just thought he was just
gonna skip through and – this is one of his rest days. He just wanted to read a couple of them, then skip
through the ______ pages. And I was like, “Tell me about,” and when he get to telling me about it, he
won’t telling me enough stuff that he need to write on his poster, so I made him go back, and he didn’t
like that. But once I made him go back – yeah, and he understood it.

**other excerpts from home visit*
*PAR: So it’s only like – if he miss what that say – like if he say _______ wrong, I only correct him. You
see what I’m saying? He don’t care for you to be like try to read that sentence to him. He wants to read
it, so he not gonna let you read nothing to him. He wants to read it, and then you just correct him on
what he said wrong. So never.
*

*HV1: And how often do you take him to the library? Would you say never –
*PAR: I just said every week. It goes – after church they go every week. Grandma takes them to the
library.
__
*HV1: Okay. How often do you buy him books? Never, hardly ever, once or twice a year, three or four
times per year –
*PAR: Probably once a year like when the school books – because they cheaper when you get it from the
school – that thing at school. So I try to at least send him with $3.00 to $5.00 so he can buy him a book,
so that be about once a year. I’ll say once a year.

01-AOU
*open-ended interview*
*HV1: That’s the first part of this conversation. And the next one doesn’t have a sheet like this. It’s
just really open-ended and again there’s no right or wrong answer, everything you tell is just really
valuable to us, and no A, B, or C, it’s really open ended. So we’re interested in knowing the kinds of
things you and Child T do in your every day routines. Tell me a typical day for Child T from morning to
bed time as much as you can remember.

*PAR: Typical for the week or a weekend?

*HV1: Just a typical day.

*PAR: First when we get up, of course you know you wash up, brush our teeth, eat breakfast, we’ll
watch TV. During the week it’s school or the weekend, usually just lounging around watching TV unless
we’re out doing _____ activities, and then lunch, either lounging or out and about, then at night time it’s
dinner, she’ll take her bath. On the weekend we either watch TV or during the week I’ll let her read a
book or something, and then it’s time for bed.

*HV1: Well it’s interesting talking more about your child books, I’m interested. Child T’s showing
(home visitor) some books right now. Where did your child get most of her books from?

*PAR: That I like to read from?

*HV1: What did you say?

*PAR: That, what I like to read from?

*HV1: No, no. She’s showing, (Home Visitor) some books. Where did she get most of those books
from?

*PAR: Probably school.

*HV1: School? Would you say the library, the school library?

*PAR: Yes, the school library.

*HV1: What are some of the things that you do to help Child T become a good reader?

*PAR: Mostly motivation because she gets lazy every once in awhile. So, just motivate her, let her
know the more she reads the smarter she’ll become, the more she’s learning. So I use that reading
___________.

*HV1: Anything you do to help her get motivated to read?

*PAR: Yes.

*HV1: Anything else besides telling her?

*PAR: I try to sit down and read with her too, make it more interesting. Say if you sit down and read a
book, then I’ll grab one of my books and turn the TV off and say we’ll read. Sometimes it works and
sometimes it doesn’t.

*HV1: What do you do if anything to help her make time for reading?

*PAR: Pretty much I just turn off the TV. Because if the TV’s on and a lot of commercials going on, she
won’t read. So that’s what I do.

*HV1: What do you do if anything to help her learn the readings of new words?

*PAR: We’ll google ‘em, get on the laptop and google ‘em, because a lot of words that I might not
understand so it’ll be like a learning experience for both of us. So I get the laptop, google it, and then
we’ll try to pronounce it and find the meaning of the word, and then we’ll try to put it into the story.

*HV1: Do you do anything to help her read words better?

*PAR: No, just on the computer, once I go on google and google words I try to help her pronounce it
the best way I can.

*HV1: Do you do anything to try to help her understand better what she reads?

*PAR: If she has questions or anything, sometimes I have to go back and read it and then we just try to
comprehend together so It’ll be a learning experience for both of us.

*HV1: What if anything do you do when she’s having a hard time with a book?

*PAR: I tell her to go back, depending on what part of the book it is. Say she reads from the beginning
to maybe like, the middle. Then she gets to the middle and she doesn’t understand it, I tell her to flip
back a couple of pages and slow down instead of like, rushing through everything try to read it, I tell her
you just need to read it word for word. Because she do, she’ll rush through and I just tell her, just start
all over and start slow.

*HV1: What are some of the questions that you ask her or you talk about books that she reads?

*PAR: The only question I ask her is like the main idea, what was the main idea of the story, that she
understand it, and if she was the author of the book, what would she do differently, or how would she
end it differently?

*HV1: Are there other people here at home that help her with reading?

*PAR: Yes.

*HV1: And who’s that?

*PAR: Either my mom or my sister. She’ll come by. If my sister’s here she’ll help. So between my
mom and my sister.

*HV1: What do they do to help her, do you know? Anything specific?

*PAR: Mmm-mmm. She’ll be in the ______with her so I’m not sure.

*HV1: How would you describe Child T’s reading skills?

*PAR: Above average, and it’s been like that since she was small. I started her early reading. From the
time I was pregnant with her I would read and talk to her you know, while she’s in my stomach, so by
the time she started walking and talking that’s when I started telling her the alphabet letters, ABC books,
color books, so I started her very young. And when she was in pre-kindergarten she was already above
average for reading and it’s been like that ever since, she’s always been like a grade level higher, very
advanced.

*HV1: All right, we’re done with that, with this first part and we’re going to have an activity together, it
going to take twenty minutes or less, and that’s going to be part of the _______. We’re going to explain
everything about, there’s some materials that you guys are going to do together for the next couple of
months. So you guys done?


01-AHR
*open-ended*

*HV1: Okay, so the next set of questions, so we are interested in knowing the kinds of things you and
your third grader do in your every day routine, so tell me about a typical day for Child T from morning to
bedtime, as well, as you can remember.

*PAR: A typical day, we get up and she gets dressed and I do her hair. We normally talk on the way to
school, me and her __siblings. Then in the evenings I normally pick them up round about six. We come
home. We may cook together. We talk about everybody’s day. I make sure that they did their
homework, because they do it at the Boys Club and then from their-, she reads or she comes in my room
and watch TV with me or something like that. And then everybody goes to bed and we do it all over
again.

*HV1: So we are interested in learning about your child’s books and reading interests, so Child T is
showing (Home Visitor) some books right now, where did you get most of her books from? So, would it
be the school library, public library, did you buy them, did somebody else give them to her. Or did the
school give them to her?

*PAR: I buy them and her grandmother also gives them a lot of books.

*HV1: What are some things that you do to help your child become a good reader.

*PAR: Um, well, I buy her books that she likes, you know, that she enjoys and basically just stay on
them and make sure that she reads and goes back over her work and stuff like that. And not rush,
because she rushes through her work.

*HV1: Um-hum. What, if anything, do you do when your child has a hard time with a book?

*PAR: Um, she never has a hard time with a book so I never have encountered that. She, most of the
time, there’s nothing that she can’t read, so she normally, if it’s something she doesn’t understand, I
may you know, break it down and explain it to her, but most of the time, she reads very well, so she
understands.

*HV1: Okay, what are some questions that you ask your child when you talk about books that she has
read?

*PAR: I normally ask her, you know, what does she-, what was the book about to make sure she
comprehending what she read. She just didn’t read it, so I just normally ask her, what was the book
about or something like that.

*HV1: Okay.

*PAR: Just to make sure that she actually, and I may flip through the pages and stuff and read
something and see if she actually comprehended what she read.

*HV1: And what, if anything do you do to motivate her to read?

*PAR: Um, I don’t have to motivate her to read. It’s more motivate her to go back over what she’s
read and make sure that she comprehends it, because that’s her thing, she loves to read, so she’ll read
it, but it’s just a matter of reading it and taking it in to remember it.

*HV1: Right, okay. Now are there other people in your home that help your child with reading?

*PAR: No, hm-mmm.

*HV1: No, okay, and how do you know if your child has done a good job reading a book?

*PAR: ‘Cause she can tell me about it. She normally can tell me about the book.

*HV1: And what makes a good third grade reader?

*PAR: Hmm, someone that, what makes a good third grade reader, someone that, you know, reads
books on their level, but if they can go to the next step, they will take the initiative to go the next step to
read something a little bit harder.

*HV1: And what should a good reader be able to do? I think you found a—

*PAR: A good reader should be able to comprehend what they read, basically.

*HV1: Right, and how would you describe your child’s reading skills.

*PAR: She’s an excellent reader, very excellent.

*HV1: All right, and what goals do you have for your child’s reading this summer?

*PAR: Hmm, my goals are to make sure that she continues to read, but she normally reads so probably
just to push her to read books that are a little bit harder. That are a little bit ahead of her. Because she
already reads a head of her level, but just to go something—

*HV1: Keep pushing.

*PAR: Yeah, keep pushing.

*HV1: Okay, sounds good. I think those are all the questions that I have. We’re gonna wait for them
to finish and then the last part, as we said, will be just going over (home visitor) has a recorder and just
going over how you guys will record your conversation that type of thing.

*PAR: Okay.

*HV1: All righty. That’s a pretty blue.

*PAR: Thank you. I need to go get some ore of those ___. I went to, what is that store over by TJ
Maxx, no it’s Marshalls. No, TJ Maxx, what is it, Anna something store? It’s like a fabric store.

*HV1: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

*PAR: I went up there and found all different kinds of really blue stuff.

*HV1: Nice.

*PAR: It was the only one that I could find that ___.

*HV1: It goes really good. She’s cute.

*PAR: She stays on the computer listening to Justin Bieber.

*HV1: Oh goodness.

*PAR: She has Justin Bieber toothbrush, but I haven’t seen her brush her teeth with his toothbrush.
She just walks around and lets it sing. She uses the old brush, but this is for entertainment.

*HV1: That is funny.


01-ARZ
*excerpts from home visit*
HV1: And how many times a week does she… does Child S read at bedtime?
PAR: Most of the times, because we read the Bible together.
*
HV1: Okay, and um, approximately how many books does she have available at home for her to read,
from 0 to 3, 4 to 6, 7 to 9, 10 or more than 10?
PAR: No, I think only from 3 to 6. [0:03:30] Although the Bible has other books. She had other books that
she read but she doesn’t have them anymore. Once she reads them, she doesn’t want to read them
again, over and over. So we go to the bookstore [sic], get new ones, and return them. We have bought
some, but we go, and¾
HV1: And you go to the library. Okay. Which is one of her favorite books that she reads?
*
PAR: She will do fine, because she loves to read, but let me tell you, when… I just got married, we
haven’t moved here yet, we are in Mexico, but in the two or three months that we were involved with
the wedding preparations I haven’t had time to sit with her and read during this time, almost never.
We were reading Proverbs from the Bible every night, one by one by one, like that, the four of us, I have
three children, [0:07:58] and we were used to, now we couldn’t read even a verse, and now that we are
here it will be different, because I won’t have to be running around for the preparations or nothing like
that, because before she would say, “Mom, they told us to read every day for 15 minutes”. We had to
read the titles they gave them to read. So we read every day for 15 or 20 minutes, because they give
them books.
[0:08:30] And she used to tell me “Mom, you have to read”, “Oh, that’s right”… at bedtime. So right
now, I haven’t had the time during the past two or three months to read with her.
*


01-BED
*Open-ended interview*
*HV1: Yeah, so it's like once you get home from work you're like, "Okay, let me do something else."
Nice. Thank you so much. Now we have a few other questions that are going to help us understand
Child N's reading habits. The first question is we're interested in just what a daily like typical routine
would look like for Child N so from when she wakes up until when she goes to bed.

*PAR1:
During the school week she gets up about 6:30, we leave about 7:00, she's at
the before school care at the babysitter. She gets dropped at school about 8:00. She gets home about
4:00, 4:15 and what happens after that, because I'm not here?

*PAR2:
She comes in my room, she tells me about her day, she show me things that the
teacher done give her that day, that I can sign and read, read and sign, or she'll read it -- she wants to
read it to me. We'll review letters and what-not and so forth, she gets a little snack, something to eat.
She'll do her homework, then I hear ____ brother, tell them to stop, leave her alone. So pretty much
that's her day.

*HV1: What time does she typically go to bed?

*PAR1:
So don't have a bedtime because she gets up in the morning and she don't
complain at school, so she don't have a bedtime.

*HV1: So just whenever she's feeling tired? Great.

So we're interested in learning some more about Child N's interest in books, and so right now she's
showing (Home Visitor) some of her favorite books, books that she really likes to read. So where would
you say she typically gets most of her books from?

*PAR1:

Library.

*HV1: Great. You mentioned that you also buy lots of books; does she get some of her books from
_____ thrift stores?

*PAR1:
me.

Yeah sometime, but most of the time I'm out buying the books she's not with

*HV1: So those are for you or for work?

*PAR1:
I buy books for everybody. But she just -- she'll ________, like when I can't get
to a library she'll get some of those and read but for the most part she get them from the library.

*HV1: Nice. So what are some things you do to help Child N become a good reader?

*PAR1:

What do we do to help her become a better reader?

*PAR2: What we done is got her to read at a very early age to where she likes to read. So the more she
reads now the better she'll read later. So we don't really have to stress on getting her to read; she'll do
it by herself.

*HV1: What do you do when Child N has a hard time reading a book?

*PAR1:

I don't think she ______ have a hard time reading a book.

*HV1: Okay. So what are some questions you ask when you talk about books that Child N's read?

*PAR1:
I know when I talk to her I ask her like what's the theme, what happened in the
book, things like that to make sure she understands it. Other than that the questions that was given in
the trifold, they gave us that to start asking those questions. Those seem a lot easier, though.

*HV1: What are some of the questions they mentioned in the trifold?

*PAR1:

What sort of question?

*PAR2: One of them ____________________ the main characters, what was the story about.

*PAR1:
What the story's about, after listing the characters. Those were easier questions
because she catches on things very easy. So that was a lot -- I hope they get harder. She needs
something that really challenge her and those questions did not challenge her.

*HV1: So last question: what, if anything, do you do to motivate Child N to read?

*PAR1:
We actually don't have to motivate her. She just go read. She gets bored and
go find something to do, even if it's reading a book. Because she's always bored so she's always look for
something to do.

*HV1: Nice. Well thank you so much; this has been so helpful.

***
*other excerpts from home visit*
*PAR1:

I just go buy books. I just buy books.

*HV1: Okay. How often would you say you do that, once or twice a year?
*PAR1:

[Laughter]. Let's go with every day.

*HV1: Are you serious? So you love to go buy books?
*PAR2:

She go to flea markets, she ______ the bus van.

*HV1: Nice. My husband gets mad at me for buying books too. Is this like a -- could you spend -- my
husband gets mad because I spend so much money on books, he's like, "You've got to stop buying
books." So you would definitely say at least once per month you buy books?
*PAR1:

I buy more than once a month.

*HV1: Okay.
*PAR1: Like I go on my lunch break if I have time I go to the thrift store. If I see books I get books.
Sometimes they have them for free so I just get them.


HV_DM_Y2HV_01-AVC_S052412_ENG_R07_R01
*open-ended interview questions*
*HV1: Perfect. Great. Well thank you so much. That's going to be great to give us a good idea of what
Child D likes and how often she reads. So now I'm going to ask you just some more open-ended
questions so we can get an idea of what Child D's daily routine and schedule looks like and where she
gets her books. So the first question is we're just kind of interested in what a typical day would look like
for Child D, starting from when she wakes up in the morning to bedtime.

*PAR:
Typically Child D wakes up around 6:45 in the morning, bath, breakfast, she gets
dropped off before school here.

*HV1: What time does she go to before-school care?

*PAR:

Between 7:45 and 8:00.

*HV1: Then she's at school -- what time does she usually get out of school?

*PAR:
Okay so when she gets the before-school care she's in before-school care 'til
about -- school doesn't officially start 'til 9 o'clock. She gets out of school and on the bus at 3:30, then
she rides the bus home in the afternoon, she gets home about 4:10, 4:15. From 4:15 to I guess 5:00
she's looking for a snack, trying to convince her brother to lay down and take a nap.

*HV1: Does that happen successfully?

*PAR:
Sometimes. I arrive home about 6:30, 7:00 and normally would try to have a
meeting, go over what she's read with her brother; if not then she reads with me. ______ bed by 9:00 -well dinner. After we read we're preparing dinner, having dinner, she's in bed by 9:00.

*HV1: Perfect.

*PAR:
Most of the time we shoot for 9:00, 9:15. It just depends on the shower's tied
up, ____ started, you know. We all had siblings to it can be a rivalry type of thing.

*HV1: Yes. I am -- the bedtime schedule with one is already challenging enough; I can't imagine three,
throwing three in the mix. Perfect. So we're interested in learning some more about Child D's books
and reading interests. So (Home Visitor) just had Child D show some of the books that she has and that
she likes. Where would you say Child D gets most of her books from? Would you say the library, public
school library or the local library? Did you buy them for her, someone else give them to her?

*PAR:
A mix of every -- I mean she probably reads about three books a month,
probably ______ favorite book, like I said, she checks out books at the library and then she gets books
from school.

*HV1: So from school dose someone give her the books from school or does she check them out at the
school library typically?

*PAR:

Both.

*HV1: So what are some things that you do to help your child become a good reader?

*PAR:
Slow her down. Slowing them down, taking out distractions, so it definitely has
to be not a lot going on around her for her to read. And just letting her know, reassuring her that
learning larger words, it'll come to you. You have to keep trying it and not give up.

[Off mic conversation]

*HV1: So when Child D has a hard time with a book is there anything that you to help her?

*PAR:
I think she gets frustrated, and even as adults we can be hard on ourselves and
children kind of fall in synch with that, just letting her know that it is okay and pronounce it out, help
with pronunciations and work together to learn the word.

*HV1: I just have a couple more.

[Off mic conversation]

*HV1: Now where is your son? What high school does he go to?

*PAR:

(School). It's (School 1) and then it's just (School 2).

*HV1: So it's like (School 3) because I notice (School 3) has the new tech and then the (School 3). Nice.
So we just have two more questions: what are some of the questions you ask when you and Child D are
reading to talk about the books that she's read?

*PAR:
The main character, what happened in the story and how she come up with that
conclusion. I think kids tend to lock on their favorite character in the book versus the main idea of the
book -- or Child D does anyway.

*HV1: And last question: what if anything do you do to motivate Child D to read or [crosstalk]?

*PAR:
I take the disk card out of the DVR. And if I was smart I would _______ and turn
her into a little video junkie but I didn't. But like I said, no TV I think is a big asset. Making the
environment readable whether she _____ a while or read a book. She gets a book and read a book. I
tell her you go through so much at school then we go through so much at work we need some quiet
time. We do. I don't want to hear a radio, I don't want to hear you popping gum, I don't want to hear
you arguing, just creating environment. I got one who blasts music in his ear, he's on the honor roll and
I'm like, "You know what? ___________________ I don't know what's going on." And I'm like, "I can
hear that. I can't concentrate because I'm focusing on like -- turn it off. I don't want to hear that type of
thing." But he gets it done. I want to think that that's their motivation: because there's nothing else
really to do. All the games things are dead and the computer's broken it's not too much they can get
into but to read.

*HV1: Well thank you so much for taking the time to share these. This is going to give us some really
good information. Hopefully help teachers know what parents are already doing really well and how
they can build on that in their classrooms. Thank you again.
*excerpts from other aspects of home visit*
*HV1: How often do you talk with Child D about reading? Would you say never, hardly ever, once or
twice a month, once or twice a week or almost every day?
*PAR: I stress to her that it's important to read because one, she likes to spend too much money so
she needs to know what _____ looks like and how much it's worth and reading is important because
sometimes you can't afford cable of have this type of paying job. I feel like it's very important ______
her that she can understand it for herself.

*open-ended interview*
*HV1: Great. Wonderful. Thank you so much. These are gonna be really helpful for us to get some
books that hopefully Child D likes that connect with his sports interests and adventure interests, so now
I just have some open ended questions. That’ll give us a better idea as to where Child D is getting his
books from right now, so right now (Home Visitor) – he’s showing (Home Visitor) some of his books that
he has. Where would you say he gets most of his books from?
*PAR1: Actually, they were mostly passed down from my older sisters that had kids. They have a lot of
books that they both passed down, so it’s mostly what he has at home.
*HV1: Wonderful. Excellent, so we’re also interested in just looking – understanding what a typical day
would look like for Child D, so can you tell me a little bit about from when he wakes up to when he goes
to bed, what a typical day looks like here at home.
*PAR1: Waking up, getting ready for school.
*HV1: What time does he usually –
*PAR1: He would usually get up maybe about a quarter to 7:00.
*HV1: Okay.
*PAR1: And he was getting ready to put on his clothes. He may eat breakfast here. Then coming back
up, brushing his teeth and we’re getting ready to try to go out. Then because he can’t be at school until
8:30, my husband gets off at 8:00 and I’m supposed to be at work at 8:00. I dropped him off to my
husband and he takes him to school in the morning.
*PAR2: It’s a car wreck.
*HV1: So you drop him off at work, because you’re still there at 8:00 in the morning?
*PAR1: Mm-hmm and my job is right around the corner.
*HV1: Yeah.
*PAR1: So yeah.
*HV1: Okay, so you’ll drop him off at school. So there’s like a tradeoff?
*PAR2: Mm-hmm.
*HV1: Great, so he’s at school ‘til –
*PAR1: They get out at 3:30. He gets here maybe about 10 to 4. He rides the bus home.
*HV1: Right. What about his afternoon?
*PAR1: When he gets home, he gets a snack, and then he starts his homework.
*HV1: Okay.

*PAR1: And then after homework. Sometimes it takes him a while to do homework. If he doesn’t have
practice on sports, he may go outside after he does his homework. Then we eat supper and then
depending on what we have to do, we ____ ______ walking, so we’ll end up going up to the track at
Northern and him and my other son would be playing while I’m walking, and so by the time we get back,
it’s time for him to take a shower to get ready to get prepared for bed. Then he sometimes reads. He’ll
read to his little brother before they go to bed.
*HV1: Wonderful. That’s so nice that (School)’s so close. I worked with a couple of teachers out there.
*PAR1: Oh, okay.
*HV1: So it’s a really nice campus. What are some things that you do to help Child D to become a good
reader?
*PAR1: Well, I tried to get him to mostly do it on his own and come back and tell me about the book,
but what I’ve noticed, I think he don’t really read the books actually. He skims through it sometimes,
and when I ask him something about it, he don’t know. Then I have him read to me, and I could ask him
questions, and then he knows. That’s what and talking about reading, like I was _______ with the
EOG’s. I noticed when he brings homework and readings that he had and I check his work. I’d be like –
and I can see what the answer is, but he had the wrong answer. I tell him to go and underline where
you find the answer at.
*HV1: Yeah.
*PAR1: So that’s kind of hard ___ ____ him to do, so we be fussing.
*HV1: Why do you think that’s hard, or why he doesn’t like to do it?
*PAR1: I don't know. Unlike _______. If you go ahead and do it and do it right the first time, it gives
you more time to play or do what you wanna do. I don't know. It’s been that way for at least the last
two years.
*PAR2: For his comprehension, comprehension of the question ____ ____ ______ the question and put
____ ____ _____.
*HV1: Oh, yeah. He’s even skimming through the questions, I think.
*PAR2: Sometimes he don’t read every word of the sentence and then that could go fast.
*HV1: Yeah. Great, so kind of building on that, what are some things you do when Child D has a hard
time with a book.
*PAR1: I would probably have him read it over again instead of just – and then what he doesn’t
understand now, he – for some reason, he has a hard time instead of coming and telling me. It was like,
“Mommy, I don’t know this word.”
*HV1: Okay.
*PAR1: He might be guessing or just that one word can give the whole meaning of the sentence.
*PAR2: And he’ll skip over it. Yeah.

*PAR1: So when he reads to me and I find out he don’t know the words, I go, “Child D, why you didn’t
come and ask me?” “I don't know.” I was like, “If you don’t know a word, just like in school, raise your
hand to see what the word is. Even if it’s on a test, if you don’t know a word, you may not know the
meaning so that you could answer your question correctly.”
*HV1: Is there anything else you guys do just to help him when he has a hard time with a particular
book?
*PAR2: ________ question him. ____ _____ question. They go back and read it, give him something.
Not give him the answer, but give him some questions that pertain to the answer so he can do the work
to go back to find it, to find the correct answer or whatever we are asking. You know, like, what or who
is the main character? Who are they really talking about?
*HV1: Yeah.
*PAR1: And I try to, especially when he have questions that you have to make an assumption, and that’s
hard for him.
*HV1: Yeah.
*PAR1: He was like, “Well, mom. I didn’t see the answer.” I said, “Child D, they are asking you to make
the assumption about the stories not in the story.”
*HV1: That’s hard for a lot of students.
*PAR1: Yeah.
*HV1: Yeah. Everyone has assumptions.
*PAR1: And so I have to question him more on that assumption question. It’s like, “What do you think
this person,” like if it was a story about bugs and I think a question could be, what do you think this
person likes, a spring day, bugs, you know? I say, “Looking at this person’s action in the story, he might
put a spring day, but the actions in the story is like, this person looks at every single bug that comes by
and be amazed.” I said, “So if she’s looking at every single bug and amazed by it and picking it up, what
do you think she likes? The bugs.”
*HV1: Yeah. Great, so you’ve kind of addressed this a little bit, but what are some questions that you
ask Child D when you’re talking about books that he’s read?
*PAR1: The main character with the whole story, the main point of the whole story, that it have a lesson
that you can learn, and I’ve gotta ask to name the characters in the story, who were the characters, like
if it was a mom or a dad.
*HV1: Nice. Awesome, so what, if anything, do you do to motivate Child D to read?
*PAR1: Just try to find books that he’s mostly interested in.
*PAR2: And give him the lesson that this is what you’re gonna read. You’re gonna ____ ______,
because if you can’t read, it’s gonna stall you right there, where you are. You’re gonna need to read and
comprehend. That’s a must.

*PAR1: Yeah and also told him there’s some things you’re not gonna like to read, but you’re gonna have
to read them in order to learn it.
*HV1: Excellent. Thank you so much. This has been so helpful. Hopefully we’re gonna get Child D
some good books that he really likes, and this is really gonna help us understand what you guys are
already doing to support him and I can give this information to teachers and you can better teach kids,
so thank you again for your time.
*PAR1: And so you would also maybe send home what you all think we should be doing along with
ideas?
*HV1: Yeah, I think that maybe later on in the summer, someone might be contacting you guys with
some little tips to help if you want, but really over this summer, we’re really trying to get an idea of what
you guys are already doing, the things that you’re already doing well to support him while he’s reading,
and you’re already doing some fantastic things, like these questions that you’re asking are wonderful, so
he’s very lucky. A lucky guy. Are you guys done?

*other excerpts from home visit*
HV1: How often do you buy Child D books? Would you say never, hardly ever, once or twice a year,
three or four times per year, or at least once per month?
*PAR1: I’m gonna say once to twice a year, because he usually buys books when they have the book fair.


01-ANR
*from open-ended interview*
*HV1: Okay. Perfect. Thank you. So now we’re gonna move onto some kind of more open-ended
questions. So I’m interested in like what does Child N’s typical day look like? Like she wakes up at –
from the time she wakes up until when she goes to bed.

*PAR: Oh, she wakes up, gets dressed for school or wherever she has to go. Then I drop ‘em off at
school. Then by the time I be at work, so she’ll get picked up – they’ll get picked up by their uncle,
brought back home and they start directly on homework or whatever they have to do. And then after
that, it’s basically free time till 9:00, well, 8:30, then they have to come in, get ready for bed.

*HV1: What does she like to do for free time?

*PAR: She’ll read. She’ll play with some of her little friends outside. But most of the time, Child N
might be in the house with a book or something like that. She’s not really an outdoor – she’ll play
outside, but she’s limited to the things she can do, so she’ll probably run in and out.

*HV1: Nice.

*PAR: That’s about it.

*HV1: Okay. That’s perfect. Great. So right now, Child N’s showing (Home Visitor) some of her books
that she has and we’re trying to get an idea of where would you say she gets most of her books?

*PAR: Oh, we’ll probably go to like dollar store or something, or donations, school. I don’t know if they
got any from the church. I think they got some from the church. I think they did.

*HV1: Yeah. Wonderful. Nice. So what are some things that you do to help Child N when she’s having
like a hard time with a book?

*PAR: Oh, [laughter] I hate when I say it; sound it out. Sound it out; pronounce that. They know I can’t
stand it if it’s not pronounced right, so they have to pronounce it right. And that’s probably why she’s

kind of a little bit articulate than what she is, but that’s how I do. I’ll sit down. I’ll let ‘em read it till they
get stuck and that’s the only time I jump in.

*HV1: Nice. Is there anything else that you do to help Child N become like a good reader?

*PAR: Tell you the truth, no. She’s the one I never have to worry about with grades and nothing like
that. She’s just…

*HV1: She’s just very self-motivated, yeah. [Laughter]

*PAR: Yes.

*HV1: Nice.

*PAR: Sometimes, tell you the truth, she’ll help me. Like no, that’s wrong. [Laughter] I guess I’m not
smarter than a third grader. [Laughter]

*HV1: So what are some questions that you ask when you’re talking about books with Child N?

*PAR: Books, I ask her – Child N likes to read – sometimes I guess she likes kids – she likes to read
books that are like below her reading level, but she’ll get to there I guess that she likes to play with little
dolls, she’ll read with ‘em. But I asked her to read something that’s like more challenging. I want her to
read more challenging books so she can get the pronunciation and the meaning of some big words and
all that stuff, so.

*HV1: Good. So are there any particular questions, like if she’s just read a book and she’s come up to
you and she’s like I love this book, are there any questions that you ask her to just kind of learn…?

*PAR: Yeah, I’m gonna [laughter] what happened in the beginning, what happened in the middle, what
happened the end? I want to know the plot, the theme, who’s the characters. I mean I go everywhere.
I mean they sometime might say I’m overboard, but I don’t think so. [Laughter]

*HV1: Yeah. Those are great. Those are great questions. Nice. So is there anything that you do to
help Child N want to read more that…

*PAR: No, she really just does it on her own.

*HV1: That’s amazing.

*PAR: I wish her brother would pick up some of that from her [laughter] but boys, Jesus Christ.

*HV1: That’s amazing. Love that. So are there any other people in the home that she reads with or
reads to?

*PAR: Grandma.

*HV1: Grandma.

*PAR: That’s about it.

*HV1: Great. So what do they typically read when they read together?

*PAR: Newspapers, my grandma reads like those novelty books, but I guess she’ll read her books.
She’ll sit there and read her book or something they’ll just talk about whatever book they’re reading or
whatever.

*HV1: Very nice. So how do you know if Child N’s done a good job reading a book?

*PAR: I make her read it over, or if she can tell me what happened, beginning, middle, end, plot, I
won’t mess with her.

*HV1: Great. So what makes a good third grade reader? Like what should a good third grade reader
be able to do?

*PAR: I think they should be able to – if they get stuck, sound out their words and pronounce it and
eventually catch onto it and get it right. One who can remember what they read and also tell you about
what they read, understand what they read.

*HV1: Great, that’s wonderful. So how would you describe – you’ve mentioned this a little bit. How
would you describe Child N’s reading skills?

*PAR: I think she’s on a scale of one to four, I probably think she’s a three. Only reason I say that is for
when she gets stuck and she’ll pronounce it out eventually, but I would say it’s __ ____ she’s not that
great. I mean just go ahead and read it and read it and read it, even go over the big words and all that
stuff, so I’d give her about a three.

*HV1: Okay, wonderful. And then do you have any goals for Child N’s reading this summer?

*PAR: I want her to – she signed up to volunteer. I didn’t know about it. She said she really wanted…

*HV1: Oh, really?

*PAR: To do it. She – I want her to finish it, all the books if time permits her doing her physical therapy
and all that stuff. But I least want her to read most of ‘em.

*HV1: Nice. So she volunteered and you didn’t even know that she had…?

*PAR: Uh-uh, I didn’t know. She brought me the paper. I said well, okay, he it goes. Then she turned
it in. Next thing I know, you guys are calling. So she’s on it like [snapping].

*HV1: Wow, oh my gosh.

*PAR: She’s reminded me [laughter] about it, so.

*HV1: That’s amazing. Great. Well, thank you so much…

*PAR: You’re welcome.

*HV1: For talking with me this morning. This is gonna be really helpful, and hopefully, we’ll get some
really good books to her this summer and…

*PAR: Yeah, I hope so. She is bugging me about this thing. I’m like Child N, you’re gonna get your
book. [Laughter]

*HV1: Yeah, we’ll get ‘em to you.

*PAR: You’re gonna get ‘em.

*HV1: Yeah. So we’re hoping that they’ll come in within two weeks of the last day of school so that
soon after school starts…

*PAR: That’s good, that’ll be the perfect time.

*HV1: Yeah. Hopefully, we’ll – I mean it would be great if we could get ‘em in a little bit earlier, but
that will be around like the latest…

*PAR: That’s cool.

*HV1: That she’ll get the first package.

*PAR: That’s good. Yeah, ‘cause I was thinking since there’s another reading summer program that I
found out about.

*HV1: Is there? Nice.

*PAR: And I’m gonna try to get her into that, too, so she’ll be up on her reading.

*HV1: That’s great.

*PAR: For next year, so.

*HV1: That’s great.

*PAR: It’s gonna be exciting.

*open-ended interview*

R10: ok...um... very well, this is the last question in this questionnaire, and I have another questions for
you, and the reason why I am asking these other question is because they are still working there and....
in the following questions there are no right or wrong answers, we are doing this only because we are
interested to know what do you and your 3rd degree girl does in your daily routine, please... Tell me as
far as you remember how is a typical day of Child K? Since she wakes up to bedtime.

[00:09:39.12]

PAR: Uh... Child K?

R10: Uh-huh

PAR: But when she... a day for her in school or a day likes this.

R10: You can tell me about a school day, because they can be different, a typical school day and a
typical day at home.

[00:09:53.12]

PAR: Yes... as I told you, they wake up at seven...they leave at 8:30 and from 7 to 8:30 they get changed,
they brush their teeth, coming their hair and at 8:30 we go outside to wait the transport and they leave
and they arrive until 4.

R10: at 4.

PAR: And then after 4. They eat and then they go play.

R10: Right, and this is what she mostly does, right?

[00:10:29.25]

PAR: Yes, approximately at 6, they do homework. They read a little and then they go to bed
approximately at 9 they go to sleep.

R10: They have a busy day.

PAR: Yeah (Laughs)

R10: And lets say... about the days that she does not go to school.

PAR: Like now? They get up around 9 and then she combs her hair, and while she is combing her hair...
then she takes breakfast and then sometimes go to the stores or any other place, you know that time
flies. I get here approximately at 4 and then we take dinner and then she goes to play. If they have
homework, they do it.

[00:11:12.27]

R10: In the weekends

PAR: Uh-huh, yes

R10: Ok... umm this is what she typically does in a day.

PAR: Uh-huh

R10: We are interested in learning more about the books of your daughter and her reading interests.

PAR: Uh-huh

R10: Umm, Child K is showing (Home Visitor) right now some books that she has there.

[00:11:32.19]

PAR: Uh-huh

R10: Where did Child K acquire most of these books?

PAR: Umm... those books... some of them are donated to us... we buy some others and these ones... we
buy them where they are cheaper.

R10: Ok

PAR: Because you know that sometimes books are expensive.

R10: Yes, yes... sometimes when I look in the back of the book I say...

[00:12:02.24]

PAR: Yeah you do not want to even look (laughs).

R10: Yes but... I see that you acquire the books from different places.

PAR: yes

R10: What are some of the things that you do to help your daughter to.... oh I sorry... What are some of
the things that you do to help you daughter to become a good reader?

R10: Do you want me too...

[00:12:28.16]

PAR: I tell her that ... umm, she reads very fasts in English and I do not understand her but when I am
looking at her she is reading fast, so there are times when I think that she is not truly reading...and I tell
her that she must read good so that she can understand what she is reading.

R10: Uh-huh

PAR: Because if I ask her about the text, she does not know because she read it fast.

R10: Ok... and you told me that she reads in English so ... do you understand some of the things that
she reads in English?

[00:13:06.02]

PAR: Sometimes I do not... Sometimes I do not understand anything but my other son is who tells me "
Child K is not reading well!"

R10: Oh ok

PAR: So he tells me when Child K is not reading well, and also... she is enrolled in that program where
she learns to... she has a problem with her speech.

R10: Oh she is in language therapy?

PAR: Yes

R10: Oh ok

PAR: Because she always omits two letters.

[00:13:32.17]

R10: ok

PAR: That is... the letters that are together.... she omits them, and she says another thing that is not
correct, so there are times when the teacher tells me that she reads a thing but she says another.

R10: Did teacher tell you what her problem is? Did they tell you what kind of problem? That is, did they
give you a name for her problem, language problems?

PAR: Yes, she has a problem because she omits two words.

R10: Do you know what the letters are? Are the same letters? Or there are different letters?

[00:14:02.11]

PAR: They are the same but I do not remember if it is the "k" or ... I do not remember which letter is,
the teacher told me that she was improving.

R10: Oh ok... you told me that your son is who tells you that she does not reads well, in what grade is
your son?

PAR: He is in 5th grade.

R10: Oh he is a little older than her. Um... if you do something, what do you do when your daughter is
having a hard time reading a book? This is what we were just talking about. What is what.... you told me
that you tell her to read more slowly?

[00:14:36.01]

PAR: Yes, so that she can comprehend what she is reading because if she reads fasts, she will not
understand anything.

R10: Umm what are some the questions that your daughter asks you when she talks about the books
that she have read?

PAR: Sometimes asks me... lets say... if she is reading history... she tells me about it, she tells me "did
you know that this happened, the books says this" she explains all when she likes it, she talks about it,
but if it is not interesting for her, she does not say anything.

[00:15:04.29]

R10: She does not tell anything.

PAR: She is like "I finished reading".

R10: Ok... umm, so she tells you what she read in the book, but besides telling you about the book,
does she ask you questions about books or about what he reads?

PAR: Yes, sometimes yes.

R10: Ok, if you do something, what do you do to encourage Child K to read? That is if you do anything
at all.

[00:15:33.03]

PAR: How?

R10: Umm... let’s say... is there is something that you do to encourage Child K to read? Or motivate her
to read?

PAR: No.... I just tell them that they must read, because almost everything now is just about reading,
and... she was like.... she says that she reads but I do not used to sit with them often when she does
homework, because with my other sons do their homework and they are watching for her.

[00:16:11.07]

R10: She receives a lot of help from her brothers.

PAR: Yes

R10: Ok, I do not know if they already finished.

R08: Yes, we are good.

*other excerpts from home visit*
R10: The next question is what are some of the favorite activities that you do with Child K?
PAR: Sometimes she reads and she tells me about what she read.
**
PAR: She has many books, because we bring her books and but when they read them they don’t read
them anymore, we bring them new ones.
R10: So you bring them books from another place?
PAR: Yes, when we see specials, she sees and picks the books and she brings them with her.
**
PAR: Umm, sometimes I read a little with her… but when uhh… My other son is doing homework and
she is reading, she goes with them and reads with them.
R10: She reads with them.


01-ALM
*open-ended interview*
*HV1: The questions that follow are all just open ended. So we’re interested in knowing the kinds of
things that you and Child J do in your everyday routine. So if you were to think about what a typical day
looks like for Child J from the time she wakes up to the time she goes to bed, can you kind of walk me
through that?

*PAR: First of all, I have to get them up because they love to stay up late watching TV. I think that’s my
mistake putting TV in their rooms. I’m really, really thinking about taking them out because I think when
I go to bed, when I get off at 12:00, they’re asleep. Sometimes they’re not asleep. So it’s kind of hard.

If I get up in the morning, I get them up about 6:30, time to get up, brush their teeth, get their
clothes on, come down and get breakfast and I do their hair and we’re running late because they drag
and that’s because they’re up at nights watching TV. And when I pick them up around 3:30, they come
home. The first thing they do is they’ll do their homework. They’ll sit.

When they finish their homework, can they go out and play? I let them go probably 25, 30, 40
minutes. It depends on the kids. If the kids are outside, I let them sit out there for a while. They’ll come
in. Then they’ll take their bath and start getting ready for supper. They’ll play, watch TV.

It really all depends. I’m off this week. That’s their normal routine when I’m here. When I’m
not here, I can’t tell you, and I think that’s the reason why they’re so tired because every night when I
come in, I got to make sure their clothes – ‘cause they take their clothes out at night. They get their
clothes out at night. I go and check to make sure what they took out, if it’s ironed or whatever, ‘cause
they have their stuff set out. Then I go and take my bath and stuff and go to bed but when I get up in
the morning, they’re just exhausted. I’m like, “What time did y’all go to bed?”

That’s another reason why I’m trying to rearrange my schedule from this night shift because I
need to be here more with them so I can monitor their schedule and then I was going to take those TVs
out. But it’s hard every morning ‘cause I know they’re exhausted. They want to stay up and half the
time I’ve got my sister’s baby and he’s a handful so they want to stay up and play with him.

*HV1: How old is he?

*PAR: He’s 11 months.

*HV1: That’s a fun age, and you do, you just want to play with them when they’re that cute.

*PAR: And he keeps them up because when he goes to sleep in the evening, it’s hard for him to go
back to sleep _____ _____ so he wants to stay up until about 8:00, 9:00 playing and they want to stay up
and keep him company and it’s just overlapping time. I’m really just starting to buckle down on their
time and their schedule because it’s starting to affect him them in the mornings.

*HV1: Okay. That’s a very helpful walk through. Thank you. Next question. We’re interested in
learning more about what types of books interest Child J and I know that she’s showing Miss (Home
Visitor) some right now. And my question for you is where has she gotten most of her books from?

*PAR: Oh, wow. We got a lot of them from Wal-Mart. She’ll check them out from school. Those are
the ones that from school, she’ll check those out. She’ll take those back. And then there’s just passed
down books from when I had my daycare. I had an in-home daycare so I had a lot of books then so I just
kept them and passed them on to them.

*HV1: I’m sorry to interrupt you. These are books you had bought for your daycare?

*PAR: Mm-hmm.

*HV1: Okay, got it. Continue.

*PAR: And so they have those books and then they have educational books. I would go out and get
them phonic books, the ones that’s helping them with math, division, comprehension, the reading part,
writing. They just have a variety. I don’t get them a set of books. Sometimes Child J will like to just sit
up and write. She’ll read and then she’ll write whatever she’s reading in her story and then she try to
practice on her writing. So it’s a lot of different books that she actually engages in. She don’t have one
set.

*HV1: It sounds like they come from a variety of sources. What are some things that you do to help
Child J become a better reader?

*PAR: I sit and I just listen to her read. Even if the word’s not right she’s saying, I’ll tell her to stop and
take her time and pronounce it again, just correcting her but letting her correct herself. I just basically
sit and listen. She’s been reading since she was three.

*HV1: Wow. Okay, great. What, if anything, do you do when you see that she’s having a hard time
with a book?

*PAR: I don’t go to her. I let her come to me because I want her to be able to figure it out on her own
because I’m not going to be there all the time to help her with it. If she’s struggling with something with
her reading, she will come to me. The majority of time, she’s reading with her sister and actually she
helps her sister out and she’s the oldest one in the older grade.

*HV1: So let’s say that she did come to you. What would you do then with what she’s struggling with?

*PAR: If she come to me, I mostly sit down with her, go over it. We read it together and I try to
express to her I mostly tell her to take her time because she’s rushing and then I just sit down and
explain to her, “Child J, it’s not as hard as it seems.” She’s not focused. She wants to hurry up and do it
and then go outside and play. She’s got a lot of distractions that are going on. And I just sit and tell her,
“Just take your time. It’s easy. You’re rushing. You’re smart. Just take your time. If it’s something that
you’re not understanding, that’s what I’m here for. I’m here to help you with that.”

But she mostly if she struggling with it, she’ll kind of sound it out. “Well, Miss R. tell me to just
sound it out or just take my time.” And I’m just, “Yeah, she’s telling you right.” If she has difficulties in
something she mostly tries to figure it out on her own and I think that’s one of the reasons I’m so
impressed with her because she does a lot of the stuff herself. I don’t have to help her but I’m there
watching her.

*HV1: Yeah, she sounds pretty autonomous. Yeah, okay. What are some questions you ask her when
you talk to her about books that she’s read?

*PAR: I mostly ask her, “Tell me a little bit about the character.” I ask her did she understand what she
was reading. Then I basically tell her to go into details and kind of tell me if it relates to a lot of things
like her everyday life and why did she pick that book. Just basic, simple questions I would say to her
when she’s reading. “Did you enjoy it? Would you read it again?” She was like, “Yeah.” Most of the
time she does.

*HV1: Great. What, if anything, do you do to motivate Child J to read?

*PAR: What I do to motivate Child J, most of the time I pick up a book or I say, “Child J, have you read
anything today?” And she’ll be like, “No, mom.” And I’ll be like, “Are you going to read today?” “Yes,
mommy.” “What are you going to read?” I don’t push her to read. It’s just something she does on her
own, but I do support her when she reads because I always try to tell her, “Reading will take you a long
way.” I just encourage her.

*HV1: Great. Okay, and you’ve kind of alluded to this a little bit. Are there other people in the home
that help her with reading, and if so, what do they do?

*PAR: Well, her sister sits and reads with her. Sometimes my nephew, he’s here. They all just sit and
read together or they’ll take turns. My oldest daughter, she’ll read a story and then they’ll listen. It’s
like they’ll take turns reading a story and try to –

*HV1: That’s really sweet.

*PAR: It’s like a role play they do. I thought it was really nice, too, because my nephew, he’s just in
kindergarten. He reads excellent and I don’t know if it’s because he’s been reading with them, but he
reads high level books, too.

*HV1: Wow. So you said you’ve got the nephew who’s in kindergarten and then your older daughter.
How old is she?

*PAR: Child J is 12.

*HV1: So you’ve got the nephew and the sister. Anybody else?

*PAR: Oh, my oldest daughter and she’s 17. She helps them out when she can if she’s not so busy or
on the phone or whatever. She helps them out with their homework and stuff, making sure they’re
doing everything ‘cause she’s mostly here when I’m at work, her and my husband. So my husband will
come down and ask them have they done their homework or whatever and then she’ll help them out.
She’s very helpful with them with their homework and helping them reading and stuff. She participates
a lot.

*HV1: Great. How do you know if Child J has done a good job of reading a book? What’s an indicator
for you?

*PAR: Oh, she’s excited. “Mommy, I read the whole book.” And she’ll just come in and she’ll start – I
don’t have to ask her – she’ll come in and she’ll talk about it.

*HV1: Great. In your opinion, what makes a good third-grade reader? What should they be able to
do?

*PAR: What makes a good third-grade reader? With my daughter, I’m just gonna talk about my
daughter. I can’t talk about the other children. What makes her a good third-grade reader is the fact
that she takes the time to read. She wants to read. She understands what she’s reading. She can talk
about what she read. For her, she’s very advanced in reading to me and she comprehends really good.

*HV1: And this question kind of relates to what you just said. You might have already answered it.
How would you describe her reading skills?

*PAR: Oh, I describe her reading skills as very good. She’s a very good reader. It’s something she really
enjoys. It’s like a passion to her, to me.

*HV1: And final question, what goals do you have for her reading this summer?

*PAR: I want her to be able to read on the level of she’s going to next and be comfortable. I want her
to just keep advancing and be comfortable with her reading.

*HV1: Be ready for fourth grade reading. Got it.

*PAR: Yes, ma’am.

*HV1: Well, those are all of my questions for you. You have been so helpful.

*PAR: Thank you.

*other excerpts from home visit*

PAR: That’s the one she always gets and she just take her time and read each story and she’ll tell about the story and I’ll b
that area. She really is. I’m really proud of her.


01-AZV
*Open-ended interview*
*HV1: That’s right. I so often have kids and parents with different names. I often forget. Okay, great.
Thanks. Now I just have a series of open ended questions and you’ve already walked me through this,
but we are interested in knowing the kinds of things that you and Child K do in your everyday routine, so
if you were to think about an average day for Child K from the time he wakes up to the time he goes to
bed, can you walk me through that?
*PAR: It takes me about 15 minutes to make him get up.
*HV1: Okay.
*PAR: He go brush his teeth, put his clothes on. We go outside and wait for the school bus. He goes to
school. He doesn’t get home until about 4:00 something, 4:15. He gets home. The first thing he do is
tell me his day.
He drops his stuff off in the hall. I fuss at him, make him go put it up, put it in his room and then it’s
time to eat lunch. He eat lunch around that time, and then after he eat lunch, it’s time for homework.
After homework is done, he gets to go to recess. He gets to go outside or play his video games,
either/or.
After he does that for about a good hour, he comes in the house, gets some water, and he usually go to
his room and start study time, either study the multiplication tables, reading, whatever the teacher
assigned him to do for that day. After he do that, it’s time to eat dinner. We eat dinner. He go take a
shower. He get his school clothes out. He’s in bed.
*HV1: Okay, great. That’s very helpful, and we’re interested in learning more about what kind of
books he likes to read and I know he’s showing (Home Visitor) some now, but our question for you is
where did you get most of his books from?
*PAR: Yard sales and also the school. They have these little festivals where you can go – book drives or
something where you can go –
*HV1: Like a book fair?
*PAR: Yeah, they send the little things home to let us know when it’s coming and he’ll bug us for
money to buy some books, so we’ll give him $10.00, $20.00, and he actually comes home and buy three,
four, five books each time they have one.
*HV1: Great, and what are some things that you do to help Child K become a good reader?
*PAR: Well, number one, I’m a very picky mom. When he does read, I actually make him go over and
pronounce the words as we break them down. Sometimes he stutters, so we have to actually make him
slow down and actually break the words down. I make him read on his own and then he will ask me,
“What is that?”
I’ll make him try to sound it out, but for me, that helps him comprehend what he’s reading because his
thing is comprehension. Child K can read something and then he’ll forget it because he’s so busy he

wants to go play, so I have to actually make him sit there and actually comprehend what he’s reading
and then he has to tell me what he read, because that’s what he does. That’s what we do in my house.
*HV1: Great, and what, if anything, do you do when you see that he’s having a hard time with the
book?
*PAR: Well, I break it down. Normally, if he’s having a hard time, it’s basically having a hard time with
the word or understanding what a word is, and I will actually give him the meaning of the word. We put
it into different sentences. At school, they teach him once you know the definition of a word, it’s easy
for you to understand it if you put it into a sentence.
He’ll put the word into a sentence and he’ll understand it. We’ll break it down. Child K is really good to
catch it on. I don't know. Just have to kind of tell him what it means and then he kind of comprehends
it.
*HV1: Okay, great, and what are some questions that you ask him when you talk to him about books
that he’s read?
*PAR: Number one, what is the whole point of the story? What was the story about? Give me the
main point, the main idea. Sum it up for me, and that's basically what he does.
*HV1: Okay, great.
*PAR: And if he doesn’t, if he can’t get it, then I make him read it again and he has that, but he doesn’t
have to.
*HV1: Okay, any other questions or is that your primary question?
*PAR: Hmm?
*HV1: Any other questions that you ask him? There doesn’t need to be.
*PAR: Those are my main questions that I ask him. I just wanna make sure that he understands what
he read, mainly.
*HV1: Got it. Okay, and what, if anything, do you do to motivate him to read?
*PAR: To be honest with you, it’s a difference with my boy, because now and then you have to take
something away from him, so sometimes I might have to threaten that mommy’s gonna take your Xbox
out if you do not sit down and do your work. He’ll do it. Sometimes you’ve gotta take some things that
they want to compromise, a give and take sometimes.
*HV1: Okay. Yeah. People motivate differently, got it.
*PAR: Very differently.
*HV1: Yeah, some it’s incentives, others it’s removing stuff.
*PAR: I remove it very quickly, because he gets a lot, so the things that he worships and cherish a lot is
the things that I will take from him, and he hates that, so ___ _____ together.
*HV1: Okay, and are there other people in the home that help him with reading?

*PAR: Yes, of course, grandma. I will take care of my grandma. She’s here.
*HV1: Okay.
*PAR: Pretty much she’s really into his life as well, so she helps out as well and his dad does too. His
dad doesn’t stay here, but he’s around him 24/7. His dad’s a very big part of the school too.
*HV1: Right, so I think this particular question is only focusing on people in the home, so let’s talk
about grandma. What does she do to help with his reading?
*PAR: If I’m working, she’ll take over or I might get frustrated. She’s a little more calmer than me. I’m
a little more stricter in certain areas.
*HV1: Okay.
*PAR: She’s a little more calm. That’s grandma, so she’ll come in and she’ll kind of, you know, because
he gets frustrated with me. Like, “Mommy just will not let me. I’m ready to get to up.” I’m like, “No.
Let’s read it again,” so she comes in. She’s good at that, at soothing out the situation.
*HV1: Great. That’s always nice to have that support.
*PAR: Oh, yeah, especially grandma.
*HV1: And just a few more questions for you. How do you know if Child K has done a good job of
reading a book?
*PAR: Because he’ll love to tell me what happened in the story. If I ask him what happened or if he
doesn’t talk about it, he wasn’t really focused or paying attention.
*HV1: Okay, so that’s your indicator?
*PAR: Mm-hmm.
*HV1: Got it. Okay, and what do you think makes a good third grade reader? What should a good
reader be able to do?
*PAR: Read the words fluently and always sum up what they’ve read.
*HV1: Okay, all right. How would you describe Child K’s reading skills?
*PAR: It needs work. He’s good. Child K’s good at reading it and sometimes it’s hard for him to
comprehend what he’s reading because he’s going so fast, but I don't know. He’s average for his age.
*HV1: Okay, and what are your goals for him in terms of his reading this summer?
*PAR: I would love for his reading to get above average, really, and I want him to be more focused in
his reading and understand what he’s reading. Just pay attention. I just want it to get a little better, but
it will.
*HV1: Okay, great. Those are all my questions for you.

*Other coded excerpts from home visit*

*HV1: All right. How often do you buy Child K books? Never, hardly ever, once or a twice a year, three
or four times a year?
*PAR: When they have the book fairs at school, I’ll give him money. I’ll give him about $30.00 so he can
bring – when he purchase the books. He wanna bring it home, so I’ll say once a year.
*HV1: Okay.
*PAR: Because the book fair is probably once a year. Move, Skeeter.


01_AYS
*from open-ended interview*
*HV1: Nice. That's fascinating. Well thank you so much for helping answer those survey questions and
now I'm just going to ask you some broader questions about some of your literacy practices here at
home. The first thing I'd love to get an idea of what Child B's schedule looks like just an average day,
typical day from when she wakes up to when she --

*PAR1:
3:30.

She doesn't have to wake up until 8:00 so in school by 9:00. She does school 'til

*PAR2: That's when I pick her up, bring her home, depending on what's after school she may have
about an hour to relax and then either _______ go to tae kwon do or --

*PAR1:

On Thursdays she'll have book club after school 'til 5:00.

*HV1: So some days she stays after school for like a book, work clubs?

*PAR1:

Not too often, just once a week. It just ended two weeks ago.

*HV1: Okay. Great and then after tae kwon do usually?

*PAR2:
Usually we're home. If there's homework it starts then while we're getting
dinner ready. We'll finish up homework after dinner.

*PAR1: But normally she has her homework done before we get home.

*PAR2:

[Crosstalk] at school.

*PAR1:

That's what I mean, she's super easy. It's very nice.

*HV1: Yeah, I hope mine ends up being like this.

*PAR2:

_________________ children are different. Our son is the exact opposite.

*HV1: Yeah?

*PAR1:
A lot of prodding but he's got some ADD issues too. So they're complete
opposites so she normally has it done before she gets home. So she'll read, she'll get on her computer
and do lots of games, math games and stuff.

*HV1: What's a typical bedtime would you say?

*PAR1:

They don't have to get up 'til 8:00 so it's between 9:00 and 9:45-ish.

*HV1: Okay.

*PAR2:

We shoot for 9:00 but it's usually closer to --

*HV1: Oh yeah, I know it's hard to get even an 11-month-old to bed at the time scheduled so I can't
imagine what it's --

*PAR1:
Well I have friends who are like, "My kids are in bed by 7:00" and then I start to
feel bad and I'm like, "Well what time do they get up?" "Well they're up at 6:00." I'm like, "Okay." They
don't have to get up -- and really she don't have to get up until 8:15 but still.

*HV1: Yeah.

*PAR2:

But she ________________ so she can eat breakfast.

*HV1: Yeah. All right, so right now (Home Visitor) is talking with Child B just about some of the books
she likes because we're interested in learning more about Child B's interests and her reading interests.
So where would you say Child B gets most of her books from? You mentioned this a little bit earlier.

*PAR1:
Barnes & Noble. I mean every once in a while we'll find one at Target but those
are kind of pricey or not a whole lot of substance.

*PAR2: ________ Barnes & Noble.

*PAR1:

Every once in a while we'll do one from Amazon online but --

*HV1: Okay.

*PAR1:

And then of course ones that we had our whole life.

*HV1: Wonderful. So what are some things that you do to help Child B become a good reader?

*PAR1:
I think it's just genetics but I also think we started learning the alphabet very
early. She had these vintage cards all along her wall of her alphabet. And then we had these rubbery
sticker things on the shower. So the whole alphabet. I mean I don't know what the answer is but I know
she was exposed to the alphabet very, very early and we went to look at preschool -- I think that made
all the difference too for many, many reasons. People yea or nay on preschool but I think it helped in
terms of socialization and learning the alphabet and starting with words and writing your name and
everything.

*HV1: Great.

*PAR2:
I mean I can remember when they were one and two and three just sitting in
the hallway just looking at books together, just the whole --

*PAR1: That's the key too is having the books in the house, having something in the house that allows
them to write and to color and to use their hands and read. It just --

*PAR2:
Well I'm saying that I think that is the practice of just sitting there, looking at the
book even if they're not grasping it. I mean I know _________ hearing my mom saying when I was -- she

would read the same book to me and then she would change the story around just to hurry up and get
through the book, and I would tell her that that's not what the story is.

*HV1: [Crosstalk] skipped part.

*PAR1:

Repetition, repetition helps a lot I think.

*HV1: Yeah.

*PAR2:

We've worn a couple books out actually. More than a couple.

*HV1: So what if anything do you do when Child B has a hard time with a book?

*PAR2:

I should paddle her or something?

*PAR1:
I don't know that -- I mean it's hard because we're in a different place. If you'd
come when we were three we would have been in a different place, I think. When she was just starting
to learn and having difficulties we'd read it with her and then she'd try and repeat it.

*PAR2: That's the biggest problem we have now is just interest. I read lots of different non-fiction and
fiction and I've tried getting the Harry Potter out because I know it's a very good progressive book, a
series of books to get up _________ more advanced type reading. And she just has not wanted to read
those.

*PAR1:
And trying to get out of the -- she enjoys these rainbow books but I don't think
they're up to her level. So trying to --

*PAR2: She doesn't challenge herself at all.

*PAR1:

-- trying to encourage her to challenge herself.

*PAR2: I mean I picked some Tolkien out.

*PAR1:

Don't scare the girl.

*PAR2: I know college students that can't get through the book.

*PAR1:

That's a tough read.

*HV1: So what are some questions that you ask when you talk about books that Child B's read?

*PAR1:
We do not do any of that. When they were little we'd say talk about the
beginning, the middle and the end, what were the characters, what's the plot, getting them used to that
verbiage.

*PAR2: There were a couple of times that we were making sure that she was actually reading and it was
kind of the same thing and actually __________________ read the first chapter. She asked ________
what happened in the first chapter, and she told us her happened in the movie.

*PAR1:

Yeah.

*HV1: Ah, caught ya!

*PAR1:
But now we really don't. I've been looking at some of these surveys that have
come home there at school and I was thinking, "Am I supposed to be doing that?" because we don't
have to, at least at this point, so I don't know maybe we should but they grasp the book so I'm happy
with that.

*PAR2: She hasn't had a problem at all at school with the comprehension.

*HV1: So what, if anything, do you do to motivate your child to read? Again, this might not be as
relevant of a question but is there anything that you found really helps motivate her to read?

*PAR1:
I think depending on the book. I mean like we were saying with those rainbow
books, it's fairies, it's girlie, it's fun and that's what she likes to read. So we've had to just let her do with
what she wants so we can keep the momentum going and keep her wanting to reading.

*PAR2: [Inaudible] mysteries.

*PAR1:

A lot more interested in mysteries.

*PAR2: She's been watching the Poirots on PBS and she's real interested in that.

*PAR1:

Figuring it out.

*PAR2: And I think that's going to be the type of book that she's [crosstalk].

*PAR1:

That would be a good one [crosstalk].

*PAR2: I think she's going to really start excelling towards those.

*PAR1:
And it's tough because you have the Nancy Drews, you have the things that are - I don't think it would keep her interest because she's very much in the now, you know, while she picks
up on history, that's not her thing. So those are a little dated.

*PAR2: ___________ 1969?

*PAR1:
No. So it'd have to have to be something of the now, of something modern that
was a mystery that involved technology or whatever.

*HV1: Kind of the contemporary age? Okay.

*PAR2:
She doesn't mind putting it on and watching but I think she'd have a hard time
reading it. Agatha Christie might be a little too much.

*PAR1:
That's too much. Plus it's got all kinds of little things going on, so I don't think
that's for her age but a mystery.

*HV1: Yeah. Wonderful. Are you guys done? Okay. Wonderful. Thank you guys so much for letting
me talk with you. Hopefully we'll get her some really good books over the summer. Excited? Yeah,
we've been amazed at these recorders they gave us.

*other excerpts from home visit*
*HV1: Fascinating. So about how many children's books would you say she has?
*PAR1:

Hundreds.

*PAR2: Well some of them she inherited from our books. But yeah, ones that we specifically bought for
her is probably about 30.
**
*PAR2: And sometimes I'll ask her what she read, what was it about.
*
*HV1: So often do you buy Child B books? Would you say never, hardly ever, once or twice a year, three
or four times per year or at least once per month?
*PAR2:

At least --

*PAR1: -- once a month. She asked for a Barnes & Noble gift card for her birthday if that tells you
anything.


01-BFK
*open-ended interview*
*HV1: Perfect. Great, so we’re done with that survey portion, and now I just have a couple of
questions just about a little bit more about what Child Z’s schedule looks like, so can you tell me
a little bit about just a typical day from when she wakes up until she goes to bed? What does
that usually look like?
*PAR: Well, of course Monday through Friday ___ ____ _____, so they get up about 7:30 and
get ready for school, get on a bus, go to school, do whatever it is they do in school. They
usually get home about a quarter to four, sometimes 4:00. It depends on how many children
are on the bus or how the bus ______ them. From there, she’ll come in, have a snack, and
most of the time go upstairs to her room or my room and do her homework and she’ll read her
book to her brothers or help the oldest boy with his reading and sometimes she’ll go outside.
Sometimes she’ll sit in the house and play her DS, eat dinner, do chores, take baths, and I try to
get them in bed at least by 8:30. That hasn’t happened yet.
*HV1: I know. It’s like you always try for the bedtime. I know. Already with my daughter being
ten months old, it’s hard to hit the bedtime, so I can’t imagine when they have a hard time.
Great, so right now (Home Visitor)’s asking Child Z about some of her favorite books, because
we’re hoping to get some books that connect with her interests, like what she likes to do and
what she already likes to read, so we wanna get an idea of where she’s getting her books from
right now, so where would you say most of her books come from?
*PAR: All her books, either my aunt has bought some. I think I got a couple of books (yawns) –
excuse me – from Name’s, but the vast majority of the books I’ve gotten have been from little
churches or whatever doing the giveaway thing. Somebody ____ ______. We have a whole
bunch of books. You wanna come pick them up? My encyclopedia collection – a guy that I’ve
been dating, his mom, she gave me the whole collection when she moved.
*HV1: Wow. Cool. What are some things that you do to help Child Z become a good reader?
*PAR: Give her as many books so she can have that option. I guess also listening to her and
talking with her and just giving her different ideas, like she wants to be an obstetrician. I ask her
about that and she’s asked me to look it up so she can look at it. That’s ____ ______. Yeah, I
heard that (laughter) (crosstalk), but I ask her questions about what an obstetrician does, and if
she doesn’t know what, I’ll look it up and I’ll read it to her and then she’ll wanna know more
about it. In the past five years, that’s all she’s talked about, being a baby doctor, actually an
obstetrician. She wants to be an obstetrician.
*HV1: Love it.
*PAR: What is it? No. You’re supposed to be relaxing. Take that out of your mouth and go sit
down somewhere.
*HV1: What, if anything, do you do when Child Z has a hard time?
*PAR: Go put it in the trash. Really? You don’t see that you’re spilling glue all over the place?
Stop spilling and go put it in the trash. What was the question (laughter)?
*HV1: What do you do when Child Z has a hard time with a book?

*PAR: Sometimes, if she’s having a hard time with it and she wants to give up, I won’t let her
because ____ ___ _____ not gonna help. It’s not gonna help you get through the book. It’s not
gonna help you understand it. It’s not gonna help you in no way whatsoever, so if you’re having
a hard time with the book, why are you having a hard time? Is it because of a word that you
can’t get past?
Is it because you’re not understanding the concept of the book? If it’s a word that you can’t get
past, spell it. Sound it out. Write it out. If it’s the concept of the book, what is it that you’re not
getting about it? What about the whole concept is it that you’re not getting? Ask yourself those
questions, but do not give it up.
*HV1: Great, so you mentioned a little bit about this just now, but what are some questions you
asked when you talk about books with Child Z?
*PAR: What does she like about the book? Why does she like it? Sometimes me and her will
even have a reading contest. Who can read a chapter book the fastest? Is that ________? I
don’t think so. Why ___ _____ choose a book ____ ______ ____, choose a book.
*HV1: Nice. Great, and what, if anything, have you found helps motivate Child Z to want to
read more?
*PAR: I’ve noticed that a lot of the times when she is upset, she’s feeling a little down, she’ll
wanna ____ _____ with the door closed and grab ___ _____ ____ _____ or to keep from
getting in even more ______ than what she already is or to refrain from saying something that
she might regret later on.
*HV1: Yeah.
*PAR: And the way ______ could be mean to her is a good thing because it’s pushing her to
use that quality time instead of fighting back and arguing and getting in trouble to go and do
something positive.
*HV1: Yeah.
*PAR: Better than saying ____ _____. It also hurts me because I wanna go beat the child’s
ass myself. Leave my baby alone.
*HV1: Yeah. It’s like the mama bear comes out. Yeah.
*PAR: _____ ___ ______. There was one girl when we first moved over here. I know her
mother got ____ _____, but I don’t care. She kept bothering Child Z constantly, constantly
calling her stupid, calling her ugly, even called her the B–I–T–C–H word. When I found ____
_____ _____. Look, you little hussy, I’m gonna kick your behind. Put your hands on her again,
and I’m gonna beat you like you’re my own, and ___ ______ you ___ _____ and I beat her like
she was my own too.
So she thinks ____ ______ Child Z one time, but we finally found out where she lived and I
talked to her mom and told her, “Look. I’m not gonna do this. My children are not gonna be
afraid to come outside. I came _______ here, just like you do, and ____ ____ ______ ____
______ all that ___ ______ ____ and if I ______ for you, you’re not gonna like it.” Her being
bullied and harassed is not a good thing because I know it’ll break her spirit, but it pushes her to
do other things that other children out here are not doing. I even got her a book telling her

about bullies and why people do _______. She actually took that to the school and showed her
teacher.
*HV1: Thank you so much for talking to me.

*Other excerpts from home visit*
*PAR: She likes reading to her brothers all the time, but when I try to read to them, they ignore me, but
when she reads to them they actually listen, so ____ ____ _______.

*open-ended interview*
HV1: There are several things we would like to know about the children, the dynamic and the routine.
The question we have for you is what are his routines? What are his routines, what does his day look
like, how is it, how a day is for Child M, how is it: at what time does it start, where he goes, when it ends.
[0:00:30]
PAR1: When he wakes up he goes to school, like today. He comes from school to his aunt’s house, she
takes care of him until we go to pick him up around 5:00. He comes home. Most of the days he plays
outside or watches some TV. [0:01:00] He does his homework. Some days we go to church, he has
something to eat.
HV1: What kind of books does he has access to, how does he get them?
PAR1: From school, most of them from school.
(background conversation)
HV1: She (HV2) is asking him about what kind of books he has, and I would like you to tell us a bit about
that.
[0:01:29]
PAR1: About the books he has.
HV1: Yes, how does he get them, where do they come from, how does he read them.
PAR1: The books he has he brings them from school
HV1: He picks them up from school.
PAR1: Most of them
HV1: What kind of things do you do to help the child read more?
PAR1: Nothing, I think.
HV1: Have you ever noticed if he has difficulty reading something?
[0:02:00]
PAR1: There are words he has a little bit of difficulty with.
HV1: And what do you do when he has difficulty reading something?
PAR1: Well, I just tell him. When I understand him, I also tell him. (laughter)
HV1: Do you ask him questions about what he reads? What kind of questions?
PAR2: I don’t understand what he is saying.
HV1: (laughter)

HV1: Do you have any ideas to motivate him to read?
[0:02:30]
PAR1: At bedtime he reads with his sister. But it has to be things like wrestling, soccer, things that catch
his attention.
HV1: He reads about them. Okay. Well, I would like you to tell me a bit about him, how is he, what kind
of a boy he is.
PAR1: Very active.
HV1: Very active
PAR1: Very talkative. He doesn’t stay still, he is very energetic.
[0:03:00]
HV1: Very handsome too (laughter)
PAR1: Very energetic
PAR2: Very active and very loving. And he likes to talk a lot.
(loud background noises, dog barking)
PAR2: He won’t stop talking, and I must confess you I don’t understand English, and what I could help
him with, [0:03:30] I can’t really help him much, because I have a lot of difficulty with the language, and
um, really I see him very… but yes, definitely, what I ask for him is do his homework when I bring him
home. But until now I had no idea he was doing poorly in reading. I knew he wasn’t doing well in school
[0:03:58]
HV1: I don’t know if he is doing poorly reading, because this program is not for children who read poorly
or who read well, it’s for all children. There are children that are doing well. One of the criteria to be
part of the program is not to read poorly. So I don’t know.
PAR2: Okay. Well... (laughter)
HV1: They chose all kinds of children.
PAR2: Okay. Fine.
HV1: All kinds.
PAR2: Definitely, I can’t handle that kid. No one can stand de fact that… he is relentless, he doesn’t
sleep.
[0:04:31]
HV1: (laughter)
PAR2: His mom sleeps, but he doesn’t sleep. He doesn’t sleep at his aunt’s house, nobody sleeps there.
And that’s the way he is.

HV1: Very active
PAR2: For him… If we are outside, he prefers to be outside than watching TV.
HV1: Well, I would like to thank you for participating in this. It has been very interesting for me to go out
and meet families [0:05:00] with children this age who are starting the process of reading. Like you, I
also immigrated with three children, male, and I know what an active kid is like. (laughter) They were
more or less his age, school age. They have all grown up, I live by myself now, they moved out.
PAR1: You miss them.
HV1: Yes. You will miss all that craziness
PAR1: Yes, when he is not home, it’s boring.
[0:05:30]
HV1: so enjoy them a lot.
PAR2: When he’s not home, it’s only the dog barking, because when he is not here this is solitary.
HV1: Solitary, yes. Well, um, it is very interesting to be with them when they, like the gentleman said,
have difficulties with the language they are learning. It is very interesting for me. Um, I would like you to
tell me what are Child M’s favorite activities, the things he prefers to do.
[0:06:03]
PAR1: Soccer. Well, I think that.
HV1: Soccer?
PAR1: Uh-huh. I think that is the only thing
PAR2: And wrestling.
PAR1: Well, wrestling too, but mostly soccer.
[0:04:30]
HV1: Okay. And what are the favorite activities you do with him?
PAR1: Well soccer, but we have gone to soccer very few times with him.
PAR2: No, what we do.
[0:06:30]
HV1: The activities you do with him.
PAR2: Really, all our life is about working and spending together as much time as we can, in school, and
mostly at church. We are there three times…. almost three days at church, and he is always learning in
some classes we give at church, he is learning there. That is the activity we do the most with him. But
going out is almost never in our plans. [0:07:03] And in those activities he is adapting to our rhythm of
life, even if he doesn’t want to.


01-AFC
*from open-ended interview*
*HV1: Perfect. All right now we're going to get to some more open-ended questions that are going to
give us an idea how Child N reads. So the first is tell me about kind of a typical day for Child N: he
wakes up at what time and through when he goes to bed.

*PAR:
I get them up maybe 7:20 every morning, or weekday. He gets up, washes his
face, brushes his teeth. I have them bathe at night -- ______ wash his face and brush his teeth. If it's
nothing here they want they eat breakfast at school or sometimes they may eat something here and
then at school or eat.

*HV1: Second breakfast.

*PAR:
He gets out at 3 o'clock exactly. Tuesdays and Wednesdays he has tutoring on
the computer from 4:30 to maybe 5:45.

*HV1: And that's on the computer?

*PAR:

Yes ma'am.

*HV1: Here at the house? What is that through? Is that with the school?

*PAR:

It's something with the school. [Crosstalk].

*HV1: It sounds interesting.

*PAR:
It helps, instead of just going to different places and doing tutoring or someone
comes here every day. He can do it on the computer. He doesn't like it because it takes too long, like I
say, hour and a half -- that kind of drags.

*HV1: Drags into afternoon playtime.

*PAR:
Yeah, but other than Tuesdays and Wednesdays when he gets home he always
eats something, then he does his homework. And he reads after he does whatever, writing or whatever
homework he has to do. Then he pretty much either can watch TV or go outside. They come in -- like
they don't really like going outside; he'd rather be in here and play with his toys or Legos or something
'til about 8 o'clock -- well they have dinner of course and then 8 o'clock they get in the tub and get ready
for bed. He has another hour to watch TV because 9 o'clock lights are out.

*HV1: Great. So we're interested in learning more about Child N's books like [crosstalk]. So right now
he's showing (Home Visitor) some of his books, particularly ones that he likes. So we can get an idea of
what kinds of books that he likes. So where would you say you get most of your books from?
[Crosstalk].

*PAR:
Sometimes I go to Barnes & Noble but a lot of them Wal-Mart. _______ all of
them come from Wal-Mart.

*HV1: They have some really good deals on books. So what are some things that you do to help Child
N become a good reader?

*PAR:
I do -- if he has any problems or anything I have him make sure he read out loud
and that way I can see where if he's stuck or anything because if he's not reading out loud I don't know if
he's reading or not. He could be in here and I could be doing something and he's doing it himself. I
make sure he's reading's out loud. That way I can see if he's stuck or if he's reading. I bought some CDs
-- that's what -- so trying to help my ____ boy now because he's not reading at all. And that's frustrating
because I'm trying. The CDs help a lot too. They help -- now see that's what I was getting -- Child N,
when I held him back in kindergarten those CDs that's reading _______ -- I like those a lot. I don't know
where -- I lost a lot when we moved.

*HV1: So tell me more about these CDs? What are they?

*PAR:
Like Dr. Seuss, I don't -- they were just different -- some of them had the books
to go along with them and them some of them came up with like a dot every time, you know, the word
and help them let them know where they was at. I think that helped Child N a lot. And I need to find
some more for Child E because like I said, he's doing kind of the same except Child N's putting more
effort than Child E. But he tries; I give it to Child N: he tries because it was from not doing anything until
he almost made the _____ -- I think he got a C that stopped him and I don't -- you know, I'm proud of
that. To me he's a A student for that 'cause he's trying. I mean anything you really put in front of him,
even if it's -- he will try or he will ask then he won't -- he wants to finish it. I give that to him: he will

finish what he starts. He just gets frustrated because it takes a long time. After that he may lose
concentration.

*HV1: Like I saw when we were doing something for too long.

*PAR:

Yeah, "Okay, I don't want to do this anymore."

*HV1: Exactly.

*PAR:
Then I come -- he may be on page one and come back he's done, or on last
page, reading the last sentence, quiet, then I come he see me. But ____________ okay yeah, what they
_______?

*HV1: So this is kind of a question that builds on that. So what do you do when Child N has a hard time
with a book?

*PAR:
I try to get him to pick out books that he can read, like I got some books that got
to go through the steps, 1, 2, 3 -- I have a lot of those over there with the different I guess ages or
reading levels, reading 0, 1, 2 -- I try to get a lot of things that -- it just start out slow and if he gets
something that's too much, if he get it at school I have him check it out again. That way we could keep -if it's a word or something he going over -- he'll be able to recognize it the next time he sees it. So if he's
stuck I'll try to help him but I mean other than that I'll let him read. But if needs help either he'll say he
does or what he'll some ask me if I'm not -- I don't really be right there watching him and ______.

*HV1: Yeah. So this questions kind of relates to what you were just saying. So what are some of the
questions that you ask when you're talking about books or -- ?

*PAR:
I ask him what was the book about, can he give me some characters or
something or what happened and -- what happened in the beginning. Then what happened at the end - can you tell me what happened in the middle? I try to just so he won't be like, "Okay I know what she's
going to ask, what's going to come first," so try to switch it up for him. And then like I said, we end up
laughing because like, "Was the Peter in it?" Just see if he was paying attention. And there was a Peter
in that book so I know he read it.

*HV1: What if anything do you do to motivate or do get Child N to read?

*PAR:

Money, toys.

*HV1: Tell me more about that.

*PAR:
Basically if they do good in school -- I mean I had to do all of them the same. If
they doing good in school, or every day ________ try to do your best and not get in trouble which he
doesn't get in trouble at all but I have different stories. But I just try to reward him like Fridays or
Saturdays. If we don't go Friday we go Saturday, pick out a toy, just for me showing him, that's showing
that hey, appreciate you trying your best because I know it's hard. It's just some things -- I wish I -- I just
try to do things with him I wish I would have been talked to more _____ so I just try to -- hey, maybe if I
was read this I would have did better. And right now it's working.

*HV1: What about to read at home? Is there anything that you found really gets them to want to read
or --?

*PAR:
Just if they want to do something, if they want to go somewhere or play a game
-- like I said, if they've been playing on games or watching TV or even outside ______ playing video, I feel
like they just sometimes too long I just, "Hey, cut it out, let's do something. Do this." Or I just tell them
to read. I mean it may not be _____ I just say, "Hey, you all need to read a book," or if they too loud or
if they fighting, "Hey, you all need to read a book." It may be five times a day I may say, "Hey, you all
need to read a book." And then if they don’t want to read the book they behave or they know they
going to have to read that book and then they boys -- they get to fighting then read a book. So they may
not like books when they -- only 'cause of me but hey, I make them, "Hey, read a book." They may like
do nothing but look at the pages but, "Read a book." I mean I tell them. I make them.

*HV1: That's great. So are there any other people in the home that Child N reads with or reads to? So
you said how many siblings does he have?

*PAR:

*HV1: Two?

Two.

*PAR:
_______ read to his baby brother if he'll listen. _______ he'll read _____ -- he'll
read, I mean if it's something good to him or something he really like my mom 'cause I mean he reads to
my mother or my sister if they come by. But yeah, my sister, if she listen.

*HV1: What about your sister?

*PAR:
If she listen sometimes 'cause he gets to ________ might forget what the books
called and everything -- never mind, "I heard that before," you know, just like -- so.

*HV1: So what kind of books does he choose to read to his baby brother?

*PAR:
Action figure book. They read something fast, something
_________________________ the fastest book he can find, something with the lessest pages, the
biggest pictures.

*HV1: So he likes books with pictures?

*PAR:
Yeah. Well to read to his brother to get him on over with, you know, you see
more pictures you know there's not that many words.

*HV1: So how do you know if Child N's done a good job reading a book? Is there anything that --

*PAR:
I say if I ask him questions and he can tell me about it unless it's the same book
that he probably know by heart, something I've read to him they know, unless it's something like that. If
it's a different book and I ask him questions or if I'm not listening to him or something but -- or I ask him
a question or make sure or I go over the book that I want him to read and see if he really read it or know
what it's talking about.
*other coded excerpts from home visit*
PAR: He will read but just as far as something he'd rather just sit here with no TV or nothing and not
read. If I tell him, "No, no TV," just rather sit there than to read but he does read when I tell him to or
he know he have homework -- he has to read for 30 minutes a day and I make sure he does that.


01-AAG
HV05: I will begin. We are interested to know what do you and your 3rd grade child do in your daily
routine, tell me please about a typical day of Child J since he wakes up until bedtime, the most you can
remember.

[00:08:58.15]

PAR: A typical day?

HV05: Uh-huh

PAR: I do not know, I do not understand the question.

[00:09:07.28]

HV05: I am going to repeat it. We are interested to know what do you and your 3rd grade child do in
your daily routine, tell me please about a typical day of Child J since he wakes up until bedtime.

PAR: Can it be a weekend, a Saturday?

HV05: A typical day
PAR 2: He goes to school

[00:09:33.23]

PAR: Yes, he gets up early at 7:30, he goes to school, he comes back, eats, does homework, goes to play
outside, he returns inside, he takes super and goes to sleep.

HV05: Ok, we are interested in learn more about the books that Child J reads and his reading interests.
Child J is showing her some books right now. Where did he acquire most of those books?

PAR: We bought them for him

PAR 2: But the question is how do you acquired them

HV05: No, where those books were acquired?

PAR 2: Some of them were acquired from the school in the book fairs.

PAR: Uh-huh, in the book fair in the school. We also buy him books in stores and libraries

HV05: Ok

HV05: You told me that he goes to the library, the public library, he bring books from there?

PAR: Yes, from the library too.

HV05: Book fairs too

[00:11:05.29]

PAR: The library

HV05: And were those fairs take place?

PAR: In the schools

HV05: Ok, (Inaudible) and you bought him the other ones, and the ones you acquired in the library

PAR: Uh-huh, he also brings books from the library

HV05: Is there any other persons besides you two who buy him books, like an uncle for example? Or
you are the only ones?

[00:11:32.18]

PAR: No, only us, the parents.

PAR: Only us the parents

HV05: Ok, which are some of the things you to help Child J to become a better reader?

PAR: What do I do? I buy him books, books that he likes, I buy them, so that he reads them and to make
him understand that he must read.

HV05: Can you tell me a little more?

PAR: Uh

PAR 2: Something that you do to make him read, to encourage him to read.

HV05: Exactly

[00:12:28.04]

PAR: I take him to the library to take books, because in the library they have variety of books,
adventure, animals and many things, the library is where we can find more. All kind of books.
PAR 2: One of the things is that they take their time to choose the book that they want, to read it here.

PAR: Yes, we take our time there. The library lends you the books for several days.

HV05: Do you do something to help him to read better the words, learn the meaning of new words, for
example?

PAR: For example, when he is reading and there are words that he does not understand, I make him to
write the words that he did not understand.

HV05: By separate

[00:13:23.17]

PAR: By separate, in a note book that he has here, he writes them and he tries to read them to learn
more, or he looks for them in the dictionary or in the computer to learn more.

HV05: In the beginning you told me that he has difficulties to understand what he is reading

PAR: Yes
PAR 2: He reads very fast, but he does not really understand what he is reading

PAR: Uh-huh

HV05: Do you do something in particular when you see that he is reading but he does not understand

[00:14:04.29]

PAR: Hmm, I make him to read the text again, because I ask him questions and he takes too much time
to answer them, so…

HV05: Which kind of question?

PAR: Such as what is the title of the book, the author, what was the book about. Name of some person,
name of the characters in the book, or what did he understood.

PAR 2: What did some character said?

[00:14:34.12]

PAR: What did he understood from the reading, which character he liked the most in the book, what
was the reading about, and if I see that he takes too much time answering me, I make him to read the
book again

PAR 2: Not the entire book, depending on the book,

PAR: Of course, depending of the book, in small sections

[00:14:59.11]

HV05: Ok, and what do you do to ensure that he has time in the day, that is, that he has time to
dedicate it for reading?

PAR: What do I do?

HV05: What do you do… there is no specific answer for this question, simply…as he has all his days busy,
he wakes up, he eats dinner....

PAR: Oh, he has to read daily.

[00:15:31.16]

HV05: do you tell him to?

[00:15:32.29]

PAR: Yes I tell him that he must read because otherwise I do not let him to go to play outside until he
finishes his homework or his reading.

HV05: Are there other persons who help him to read?

PAR: His brother.

HV05: Uh-huh, and what does his brother do to help him?

[
[00:15:54.22]

PAR: He reads with him, sometimes those books that he likes, such as the Diary of that kid, this one, the
two of them like it, the girl also reads and they both talk about it.

HV05: How old is the brother?
PAR: Eleven

HV05: Eleven, and the girl?

PAR: Eleven, she is the girl.

HV05: Oh she is the girl.

PAR: She is the girl he only has one sister.

HV05: OK

PAR 2: They also read, he was born here and she was born in Mexico, so she reads and talks him mostly
in Spanish, so she teaches him sometimes Spanish

PAR: That is one of the ways he learn

HV05: I will put this here. How do you know if Child J has done a good job after reading a book?

[00:16:58.12]

PAR: How do I know?, because when I ask him he tells me the answers correctly, that means he read
well, that he liked the book, because when he does not, he does not answer anything.

HV05: What does a good third degree reader? What is a good reader capable to do?

[00:17:31.20]

PAR: Of third degree? He must know how to read better, right? And must comprehend what he is
reading, because he is on a higher grade, when he was in first grade it was harder for him, in second
grade it was hard for him to express himself, and now he does better,

[00:17:56.20]

PAR 2: Yes, he used to read always very fasts, we have teach him the exclamation marks, punctuations,
all of that. We explain him what a narrator is we tell him what he must said “Look what I am doing here”
for example or that certain character said this and that . They told us in school that we teach him in that
way and we try to explain him the exclamation mark when he has to raise his voice, we tell him that he
must raise his voice, or when a character raise his voice, or when it is question mark. Things like that.

PAR: We try to explain him to read according the book, the expressions of the person who is talking in
the book, when the person is thrilled or when the person is sad, I try to make him read as if he is living
what is happening in the book, the story, that is what we tell him, he must feel what he is reading in the
book, not just reading the book, but to feel what he is reading.

PAR 2: As if he is who is telling the story

[00:19:28.18]

HV05: Uh-huh
PAR: The one who wrote the story

HV05: How would you describe Child J´s reading skills?

PAR: What? I did not understand the question

HV05: How would you describe the reading skills of your child?

[00:19:52.12]

PAR: I think they are better.

HV05: Can you elaborate a little more on that?
(Laughter)

[00:20:08.13]

PAR 2:: The skills, well, he must read, (Laughter), he begins with the author´s name the book´s title and
we always tell him that if it is a big book he must read only one part, two or three pages per day and as
we told you, we instruct him not to read the whole book in one day, he must read it one part at a time
so that he can understand it. Now, as I was telling you, they recommended in the school that we pay
attention in that he understands what he reads, that is what he does now.

HV05: What objectives do you have for the child´s reading in this summer?

PAR: Which objectives?

HV05: Uh-huh

PAR: He must improve, he must understand better what he is reading, his level must improve better
than it is now, that is what I expect this summer, he must read a little better, so that next year he does
better, with better grades.


01-AIS
*open-ended interview*
*HV1: So that is the first half of our stuff together. The next is just a series of open-ended questions
and I won't be taking any notes. First question: we're interesting in knowing the kinds of things that
you and your third grader do just in your everyday routine. So if you could just tell me about a typical
day for Child S from the time he gets up to when he goes to bed.

*PAR:
Okay, getting up. Let's see, he gets up probably about 6:30 and I usually wake
him up and he -- you want details like brush his teeth?

*HV1: Whatever you consider his routine. Don't be afraid of being too longwinded, just whatever you
think matters.

*PAR:
Okay. So a typical day for us would be 6:30 I wake the kids up and then they get
ready on their own -- well, Child S and his older brother do. And he -- Child S doesn't have to be to
school until 8:45; I go to work earlier than that. He goes to his other grandfather's house in the morning
and his grandfather takes him to school for me so when we leave from here we take Child C to school,
who is my oldest son, and then I drop off Child S at his grandfather's house and he does all this stuff
there as far as brushing his teeth, washing his face, eating -- he does all that over at Grandpa's house,
although he does get dressed here.

From there Grandpa takes him to school and he's in school from 8:45 to 2:30
and Grandpa picks him up from school at 2:30 and then he goes to Grandpa's house. I get off at 4:00 so
from the time he gets home, usually about 3:30 he usually starts his homework. He usually doesn't have
to be told to start his homework; he usually just goes ahead and does it on his own. When he finishes
he's outside playing, or if he doesn't finish all of his homework then he'll just go outside and play for a
little while then I pick him up at 4:00 -- well I get off at 4:00 so I pick him up about 4:30ish. From there
we come home, he will finish his homework and he usually like eats a snack or something and he's
either outside playing or playing a video game or watching a little bit of TV. Then 7 o'clock is shower,
and just like regular like interaction like playing with his sister or playing with his brother, just laying
around on the bed watching TV with me or whatever. That changes daily. Then it's 8:30, 9 o'clock it's
bedtime.

*HV1: That's a perfect explanation of a routine. That's what we wanted. Thank you. So second
question: we're interested in learning more about Child S's books and his reading interests. I know right
now Child S is showing (Home Visitor) some of his books. So our question for you is where does he get
most of his books from?

*PAR:
something like that.

The book fair at school and also from the book store, Barnes & Noble or

*HV1: Next question: what are some things you do to help Child S become a good reader?

*PAR:
I encourage him to read and I tell him the more you read the better you become
at it and also encourage him to read out loud. I love to hear him read and have an expression in his
voice when he's quoting something from the book, when people are talking. Just telling him that
reading is great.

*HV1: What if anything do you do when you see that Child S is having a hard time with a book?

*PAR:
I don't really see Child S having a good time; I really don't. Maybe because of
the books he's getting he's not struggling with them so far. Maybe as he gets older and the books get
harder maybe it might be something different.

*HV1: What are some questions you ask him when you talk with him about books he has read?

*PAR:
Asking him what he found interesting about the book or who are the characters
in the book and what are they doing, stuff like that.

*HV1: What if anything do you do to motivate him to read?

*PAR:

Buy him the books, especially when it's a series he likes and he has all of them.

*HV1: How many are there in that series? I need to get up to speed on this if I'm going to talk to kids
about it.

*PAR:

You've probably got to ask him; there's probably at least eight to ten right now.

*HV1: Wasn't there a movie?

*PAR:

It is yeah and he has the movies -- there's two of them.

*HV1: Does he just love it?

*PAR:

Yeah, him and his brother both, yeah.

*HV1: How old is the younger brother?

*PAR:
Child C is going to be 12 next Wednesday. Yeah, he's in sixth grade. I think Child
S was really interested in the series probably earlier than he should have been because it's kind of -- for
his age now I think it would be more appropriate but he was interested in it when he was in first, second
grade.

*HV1: He's been an avid reader since a long way back.

*PAR:
series.

And that's because he's got an older brother so his older brother was into the

*HV1: That makes a difference. But I interrupted you. You said you motivate him to read by just
buying him the books? Was there anything else you wanted to share?

*PAR:

No.

*HV1: I'm going to take a break and see how they're doing on their progress and be right back.

They're almost done so I'm just going to ask you a few more questions. Are there other people
in the home that help Child S with his reading and if so what do they do with him?

*PAR:
No I don’t think so, other than his older brother, and I don't know if it's really
helping him but maybe it is if they're talking about it.

*HV1: What does Child C do?

*PAR:
Just the two of them even talking about the book itself, whether they intend to
be helping each other with the book or not just them talking about it is kind of helpful.

*HV1: Okay. How do you know if Child S has done a good job of reading a book?

*PAR:
I guess I don't really know unless it's something for school then I know he's done
a good job from his summary of it or his grades.

*HV1: So when you say a summary do you mean his ability to articulate to you about it?

*PAR:

Right or writing it down on paper.

*HV1: His grades? I know that's kind of a vague question so that's a helpful answer. And what do you
think makes a good third grade reader? What should they be able to do at that age?

*PAR:
Wow. A third grader as far as reading -- what should they be able to do? I think
they should be able to read chapter books and I think they should be able to identify the basic I guess
fundamentals of reading, like they should be able to identify main characters, a setting, what's going on
in the book, how did the people feel. I think they should be able to answer questions like that.

*HV1: And two more questions left: how would you describe Child S's reading skills?

*PAR:
don't know.

Oh man. I'm _____. He does a very good job at reading, putting it into words. I

*HV1: That's fine.

*PAR:

I don't know how to describe his reading skills. Is that what you asked?

*HV1: Yes. How would you describe his reading skills?

*PAR:
words.

He's like above his grade level right now. He's -- I don't know how to put it into

*HV1: That's fine. Anything you can tell us is helpful, and again, these are pretty vague and openended so don't even worry about it. Last question -- and this should matter: what goals do you have for
Child S's reading this summer?

*PAR:
I want him to expand his mind into reading something other than just this Diary
of a Wimpy Kid and he also likes these other series too but I want him to explore the overall possibilities
of all the books out there he can be reading and there's just so much more he might find interesting that
he might not even thing about right now so I want him to be very open-minded when it comes to
reading. And I would like to him to do more reading on his own and taking the time to actually know
what he's reading and if he doesn't understand it then to ask questions.

*HV1: So it sounds like just diversifying their interest. So those are all my questions for you. Thank
you. It sounds like they have a little bit longer to go so why don't you and I just get ahead -- we can just
do the gift card and the receipts and stuff right now so I'll just get that.


01-ALZ
*From open-ended interview*

*HV1: Yeah. So we’re interested in knowing the kinds of things that you and Child K do in your
everyday routine. So if you were to walk me through a typical day for her – from the time she wakes up
‘til the time she goes to bed – what would that look like?

*PAR: During a school week? Because it’s different on the weekends.

*HV1: Yeah. Sure. During the school week.

*PAR: Okay. We get up at – she gets up at 6:00. And then we rush to get her to early morning care.
Because I have to be at work at 7:00. And I pick them up from school at 3:30, right after dismissal.

And when Kids Notes was in, she went right to Kids Notes every day, except for Wednesday, ‘til 5:30.
Then we came back, picked up everybody from their extracurricular activities.

We get home – I’d say it’s about 6:30 or so. We eat. And then while I’m fixing dinner, they switch off.
They have weeks – “Okay. It’s your week to take your bath.” And they’re scheduled out to take their
baths.

And then it’s homework time. But she does her homework in the car, and so I can just check it. And
then it’s time to go to bed – 8:30 is reading time.

And then she tells me like what’s going on in the book, and I have to fill out her reading log. And then
it’s time to go to bed. That’s how it is during the week – during a school week. Yeah.

*HV1: Okay. Great. That’s perfect. Thank you.

*PAR: Okay.

*HV1: We’re interested in learning more about her books and her reading interests. I know she’s
talking to (Home Visitor) about it right now. But our question for you is: where did you get most of her
books from?

*PAR: Actually, I get them from Barnes and Noble, or basically at the book fair at the school, during the
book fair. I do it there. And that’s mainly where I get her books from – at the book fair.

*HV1: Okay.

*PAR: Because the schools really – they have a sense of what their students like.

*HV1: Yeah.

*PAR: And so that’s what I do. And she loves – she lets me know. “Okay, Mom. I need $20.00 for my
books for the book fair.”

*HV1: Uh-huh.

*PAR: You know? “Okay.” “Please.” “Our book fair is over blah, blah, blah, blah.” So I have to make
sure I get her books from the book fair. So that’s where I usually get 'em from.

*HV1: Okay. Sounds like she keeps you accountable.

*PAR: Yeah. Yeah. Because she also wants to do Hunger Games. I’ve got to get that from Barnes and
Noble.

*HV1: Oh, wow.

*PAR: So that’s after – if we have time.

*HV1: Did you see the movie?

*PAR: No.

*HV1: It was pretty intense.

*PAR: Yeah. That’s why I want to read the book first.

*HV1: Yeah. I mean it was awesome. But even just for me – I was like, “Oh, this is so intense.”

*PAR: Yeah.

*HV1: But it’s a cool story.

*PAR: Yeah. So we’ll see.

*HV1: So book fairs. Okay. Great. And what are some things you do to help her become a good
reader?

*PAR: Well, when she was younger, I used to read to her all the time at night. And, also, during free
time, we would have book time – like you have circle time.

*HV1: Uh-huh?

*PAR: You also had book time with Mommy. And it was like – I would just read to them. And I believe
in reading with inflection and really keeping 'em focused, and then asking questions about – “Oh, what’d
you think was gonna happen? Ooh.” You know?

And I just make it really interesting. So I started that – ever since they were little. You know? And we
have our favorite book like even to this day. Another Monster at the End of this Book with Elmo.

*HV1: Uh-huh?

*PAR: Yeah. And I’d like do the voices. And I think that hooked them in when they were little.

*HV1: Oh, I’m sure.

*PAR: And so, basically, that’s what I do. And today, what I do – for right now, her developmental
stage is – just ask her questions about the character. “Okay. What’s happening with him now? Oh. He
swallowed the doggone key again?” You know?

And it’s just remembering the story, so she knows that I’m connected. And that is important to me. I
think that’s the key thing.

Because if I like don’t remember certain things, I can tell she’s like, “Mom.” So I have to make sure that I
remember details, and help her tell me – you know?

*HV1: Uh-huh.

*PAR: So that’s how – I think – yeah.

*HV1: Okay. Great. And you had – well, that’s the fifth question, so I’ll wait. Next question. What, if
anything, do you do when you see that she’s having a hard time with a book?

*PAR: Basically, I ask her – like I’ll have her reread something. Or she has to look up the defi – like look
up the words to help her understand.

*HV1: Okay.

*PAR: If she can’t tell me –

[Interruption]

*PAR: Sorry. And basically just helping her understand certain things with context clues and that kind
of thing.

*HV1: Okay.

*PAR: Basically, what I mean – you know what I mean. Right?

*HV1: I know what you mean. I do.

*PAR: Okay.

*HV1: Yeah. And you’ve already alluded to this, but what are some questions that you ask are, when
you talk to her about books she’s read?

*PAR: Basically, how do you feel about the character? Is he a nice guy? Is she a nice guy? Is she nice?
You know? That kind of thing. Nothing really – what are some of her favorite things she likes to do?

*HV1: Uh-huh.

*PAR: Very like – not like “let’s have reading class” questions. Just getting to know the character. You
know? That’s the kinds of questions.

*HV1: Yeah. Just very natural engagement. Yeah.

*PAR: Right. Right. Because she was reading a story about the cats, and I was like, “Whoa. So how do
you think T feels about that?” You know? That kind of thing – just getting into the head of the
character.

*HV1: Okay. Okay.

*PAR: Yeah.

*HV1: And what, if anything, do you do to motivate her to read?

*PAR: Well, you know the schools do a great job with their motivational incentives.

[Interruption]

*HV1: We’re almost done with this part. So you said the schools do a really good job of motivating her
to read.

*PAR: Yeah. I really – it’s – they have like – in the summertime, we have goals that we have to do and
incentives that I implement here. Or in our family, we read dah, dah, dah, and you get so many points –
that kind of thing. And then, at the end of the week, if you have certain points, then you can do X, Y,
and Z.

*HV1: Uh-huh.

*PAR: But it’s like – it’s just a scheduled time in the summer that we have reading time. You know?
And, basically, that’s it. Yeah.

*HV1: Okay. It’s kind of like employee-based incentives.

*PAR: Yeah. And just praising. You know?

*HV1: Okay. Are there other people in the home that help Child K with her reading?

*PAR: My brother – he’ll ask her questions about certain things she’s reading. Yeah. He has, on
occasion. Yeah.

*HV1: And how do you know if she’s done a good job of reading a book?

*PAR: Because she understands what she just read.

*HV1: Okay.

*PAR: You know? And she can basically convey that with ease.

*HV1: Got it.

*PAR: Yeah. And I can tell the difference when she doesn’t understand something. Because I’ll ask her
questions, and she’ll be like, “Well –” “Okay. Let’s read that again. Let’s find out why.” You know?
That kind of thing. So when she has a foggy answer, I know she didn’t understand.

*HV1: Okay.

*PAR: Yeah.

*HV1: What do you think makes a good third grade reader? What should they be able to do?

*PAR: I believe they should be able to clarify what they read, and be able to see it. You know what I
mean?

*HV1:

Uh-huh.

*PAR: And have that visual, and connect it to what’s going on in the story. They really need to
understand the characters, where it’s taking place.

And what are the problems that the characters are facing? You know? In order to really get into the
story. And, of course, they need to understand the different terms, in order to read.

*HV1: Okay. Great. And two more questions. How would you describe Child K’s reading skills?

*PAR: I think they’re above – I know they’re above grade level. She’s above grade level.

*HV1: Okay.

*PAR: She was tested. She’s always like – she’s two grades above grade level. The Lexile scores are
different with the actual – like some Lexile scores are not applicable to the testing. So yeah. But they
said she’s two grade levels above.

*HV1: That’s great.

*PAR: When she took her EOGs, she scored a 4.

*HV1: Good.

*PAR: Yeah.

*HV1: And last question. What are your goals for her reading this summer?

*PAR: To keep her reading fluency high. Also, to read more with inflection, so she can hear and see
better. And then increase her vocabulary.

*HV1: Okay. Great.

*PAR: Yeah. That’s why we’re doing like Breaking Dawn and, maybe, Hunger Games.

*HV1: Okay. Great.

*PAR: Okay.

Thank you.

*HV1: Those are all my questions for you. The child portion always takes a bit longer.

*Other coded excerpts from home visit*
*PAR: She reads like whatever homework assignment she has. She makes sure she gets it done. You
know? She’s just really always been that way.
And she just loves learning. Like she’ll ask questions that I have to look up and research to find the
answer. She’s always been that way.
*
PAR: Yeah. And so we sing songs. Or I listen to her music. You know? Just talking. You know? And
reading. I know that sounds weird. But –
*HV1: It’s not weird at all.
*PAR: We’ll sit down. And like she’ll read her story, and I’ll be reading mine. You know? She’ll be
asking me about mine. I’ll be asking her about hers.
*
*PAR: Yeah. And she wants me to – right now, I’m reading – to take out – because I already read – I did
it with Breaking Dawn. But I’m reading ahead, so I can see which part she can’t read.
*HV1: Uh-huh.
*PAR: So that’s what I’m doing right now. So one of our – we’re gonna do Breaking Dawn together.
*HV1: Uh-huh.
*PAR: Yeah. So I have to read it first – again. Because I forgot – my daughter – my oldest girl and I read
Breaking Dawn together.

*From open-ended interview*
HV05: Ok, this is the first part of our conversation, we are going to the second part and I repeat again
there is no wrong or right answer, is like the way you are speaking with me. You simply talk and that is
all. The following questions to not have options like the previous ones, right?

HV05: We are interested to know what do you and child do in your daily routines. Tell me please about
one typical day of Child U since he wakes up to bedtime, the most you can remember.

PAR: Well, depending the time. For example, when I wake up... lets say the days I rest from work, the
first thing is give them breakfast then as they have a soccer tournament, I have to get them prepared for
the play and then we go for lunch. And then we come home and they go to play. That is like a typical day
when I rest, the weekends.

HV05: That is until afternoon, but and then?

[00:13:24.22]

PAR: After we come home, we goes outside to play with his friends, then he must read sometimes, he
must clean his room and then goes for dinner and then he goes to sleep, that is a whole day.

[00:13:53.29]

HV05: We are interested in learn more about the books that Child U reads and his reading interests.
Child U is showing her some books right now. Where did he acquire most of those books?

PAR: Umm.... his older brother and I bought them in the school.

[00:14:23.00]
HV05: The older brother.

PAR: and the others... well those books are of the three of them. One buys a book and the three of them
read it. The older brother and the middle buy them.

HV05: Who buys them, the older one?

PAR: Yes, we bought them all for the older one when he was on elementary school, so the books are
here and they read them. Did you understand me?

[00:15:03.17]
HV05: I do not know how old is the older one?

PAR: He is 15.

HV05: And he bought them, for him.

PAR: We bought them for him.

HV05: Who bought them?

PAR: We did.
HV05: Mother and father, ok.

HV05: So those books are of the older brother and he does not read them.

PAR: No

HV05: And now he gave them to Child U.

PAR: Yes he gave them to the other one, to Child U and younger one.

[00:15:30.25]
HV05: Oh ok

PAR: And the other one, well. We buy him books when we go to the book event, they give him books.

HV05: Where?

HV02: There is like a ... a program that they have for children. So they go to they library and they grab
the book they want.

HV05: Oh, it is a school program.

PAR: Yes, they can´t grab any book but they give them a selection to pick from.

[00:16:00.17]
HV05: Those are books from the school´s library?

PAR: Yes

HV05: So, amongst these books there are books that you bought for the older brother, who in turn gave
them to the middle one and then the younger one, Child U, and there is another which come from the
school library program, okay.

HV05: What are some of the things you do to help Child U to become a good reader?

[00:16:36.03]
PAR: I think that I do not help him very well because I do not how to read very well, I read him books in
Spanish but he gets bored because he does not understand very wall what I explain to him.

HV05: He does not understand Spanish or what you are reading to him?

[00:16:54.22]
PAR: The things that I explain him. HE reads in English but as I told you, I do not understand him
sometimes; I do not understand some words. He does not like when I want to pronounce some word
because he says that I do not read well. That applies for his books, I read correctly the books in Spanish,
but he does not understand me. So I can´t explain him in English how the word must be pronounced.

HV05: Do you do something in particular to help him to learn the meaning of new words?

[00:17:32.27]
PAR: Yes, through spoken word, that is. When there is something that he can pronounce well, I correct
him.

HV05: Do you do something to help him to understand what he reads?

[00:17:53.02]
PAR: When I can explain it, yes. I explain him with examples, figures or ... by telling him "No, it is that
way" I try to tell him in a way he can understand. But anyway, if he does not understand, he asks her
sister. He tells her "look, I do not what this means", things like that.

HV05: Do you do something to make him to take a time to read?

[00:18:28.13]
PAR: umm... what we usually do is telling him that if he does not read he is not going to make what he
likes to do. For example, he likes to play soccer a lot; if he does not read then he is not going to play
outside. So this is like some pressure on him, lets say. He must read so we let him play.

[00:19:01.19]
HV05: Do you do something to help him to read the words better?

PAR: No, because I do not understand them sometimes.

HV05: What do you do to encourage him to read?

[00:19:27.23]
PAR: Umm... I read a tales book that I have. I have a tales book in Spanish so I read it with him. Or I
make him read the book that he likes the most.

HV05: What do you do when he is having a hard time reading a book?

[00:19:59.10]
PAR: Uhh... I ask my son how I can pronounce a word so that... I tell her to help his brother to
pronounce something because I do not know how to do it. I usually go to him because he is who knows
more.

HV05: The older one.

PAR: Yes, the older one.

HV05: The one who is 15.

PAR: Yes and the middle one too, they two help him.

[00:20:31.25]
HV05: How old is the middle one?

PAR: He is 11.

HV05: What are some of the questions that you ask Child U when you talk with him about the books?

PAR: "Why?” that is what he tells me, "why"? "Why I have to read mom?" "Why I have to read every
day if I go to school and I read in there, that is what he tells me.

HV05: But, what question do you ask him when you talk about reading?

[00:21:03.09]
PAR: Umm... when he is reading a book... I ask him questions on what the reading was about, so for
example I make him questions on the book, such as why some character did this and this and why, is an
example. I ask him what some character is mad and the reason, for example, things like these, things
that he can explain.

HV05: Is there any other person that can help him to read?

PAR: Umm...

HV05: It can be a brother, the father, an uncle.

PAR: Possibly, his brother. But his friends also help him to read.

[00:22:01.27]
HV05: Which brother? The older one or the middle?

PAR: The middle one.

HV05: The middle one helps him.

PAR: The middle one helps him the most because the older one only helps him with homework that I do
not understand and he helps him, but he likes a lot reading with his friends.

HV05: His friend from school or from...

PAR: They are from the neighborhood.

HV05: Neighbors.

HV05: How do you know if Child U has done a good job reading a book?

[00:22:32.07]
PAR: I think he has not done a good work.

HV05: No, how do you know if he has done a good job reading a book?

PAR: I do not understand.

HV05: Ok, let’s see... I will repeat the question, how do you know if Child U has done a good job when
reading a job?

[00:22:59.14]
PAR: By asking, I think. By asking if he understood what he read. And likewise, I check what he said to
see if it is correct, because he talks in English and I do not understand a lot, but when that happens I ask
him what he is trying to tell me and he answers me, so I that way I verify if what I understood was right
or wrong. Depending on what he says.... but, we are never alone, because there are things that I do not
understand, so I must ask them.

HV05: How would you describe Child U´s reading skills?

[00:23:49.29]
PAR: They are not very good. I understand that he is a very distracted one and he does not pay
attention, he reads because he has to do it but he does not put attention on it. I think that is the reason
because sometimes I ask him some question and he answers me that he will answer later. He then
repeats again what he was reading again and then he tells me, but he does not concentrate in what he
reads.

HV05: What objectives do you have for Child U in this summer?

[00:24:35.19]

PAR: Well, I would like that he gets better in reading, because does not very well in reading, nor in
math. He does not pay much attention on those two.

HV05: We have finished the second part, and the finished their activities too

*Other coded excerpts*
HV05: What are some of the favorite activities that you do with Child U, together?

PAR: Usually we when go out to some place we go out to eat or I play videogames with him. When he
wants to read he tells me that he wants me to read with him.
HV05: Ok, what is of Child U ´s favorite books?
[00:04:34.16]
PAR: He has a lot of books in English. Now, I can´t read in English very well, so he... but... I don´t know...
he has books of....I do not know the name..."Lito" I do not know, but when he reads something and I am
with him I correct his mistakes and he corrects me when I say something wrong.
*
HV05: How frequently do you read with Child U, or how frequently do you read together? A) Never or
almost never b) one or two time per week c) one or two times per month d) almost every day
[00:06:13.04]
PAR: About two times per week. He does not like it when I read with him because he says that I do not
read like him, he does not understand what I read, so I read with him and when he is done, I ask him
questions about the book, or he asks me when he does not know something, and I help him. But as for
reading everything, no. He does not like me to help him; he says that I do not read well.
*
PAR: Yes, well I am always him. I am not always telling him that he must read, but he is always with me
when he is reading. He goes with my to my bedroom, there we read together. He does not get out until
he finishes what I assign to him. I am always listening to him. But usually, we can say that he does not
read every day but about 4 times per week. Because when I am not in house, his father or his brothers
listen to him.

HV05: You say that they listen, but they do not talk with him, or how?
PAR: Oh well, his brother talks with him about the books, he talks about what he read. But not his
father, he does not ask him anything about the book.
*
HV05: How frequently does Child U read for fun in his own time? Would you say that a) Never or almost
never b) one or two times per month c) one or two times per week d) almost everyday?
PAR: He actually wants to read everyday because we tell him that before that... for example, he comes
from school to eat and then he goes to play for a while, then he does his homework and then he goes to
read. If he does not read him can´t go to play outside.
*
PAR: I almost never take him to the library. I take him in very rare occasions. I take him...well not now, I
used to take him but not now because when he was in the school we used to go to the library, but now,
because he is not going to school.
*
HV05: How frequently do you buy books for Child U? a) Never or almost never b) one or two times per
year c) three or four times per year d) at least one time per month
[00:10:30.28]
PAR: Maybe one or two times per year. The other children here have books, so he reads those too.

*open-ended interview*
*HV1: Great. Wonderful, so that’s the end of the little survey, and now I’m just going to get a chance
to understand a little bit like what Child C’s daily schedule looks like and that’s going to help us get an
idea of when she’s reading and what she’s reading and how as teachers, we can build upon that, so tell
me what’s a typical schedule for Child C? Like she wakes up at and then till she goes to bed.

*PAR1: Oh lordy, the girl gets up at 8:00.

*PAR2: Well, technically, you get her, Monday through Friday, you get her up at 7:30.

*HV1: 7:30, yeah.

*PAR1: Go to school, get ready for school.

*HV1: Nice.

*PAR2: And on the weekends she’ll wake up on her own. I don’t know what time she wakes up because
I’m usually still asleep because I work at night.

*HV1: Do you?

*PAR2: Yeah.

*HV1: So you work like from what time to what time?

*PAR2: I work from 4:00 to midnight.

*HV1: Are you serious?

*PAR2: Um-hum, so usually when I come home, I don’t fall, I can’t fall straight to sleep. I don’t usually
fall asleep till about 3:00, so usually when I’m falling asleep, and I’m waking up about mid-day, they are
already up. So I wouldn’t tell you.

*HV1: Yeah, yeah.

*PAR1: 8:00, 9:00 we be watching TV, cartoons.

*HV1: Okay, nice. Okay, and what time does she head to school and do you guys like drop her off? Or
does she take the bus.

*PAR1: Hm-mmm.

*PAR2: The bus picks her up right here.

*HV1: Oh nice, oh good. What time does the bus come by?

*PAR1: The bus will come here at 8:00, come to pick her up. She gets home around 4:00.

*HV1: Okay, and what does her afternoon schedule look like?

*PAR1: In the house.

*HV1: Okay, so she comes in, and does she just play with—

*PAR1: ____.

*HV1: Great. And what time does she typically go to bed?

*PAR1: Oh, shucks. Um, about11:00, 12:00 close to 1:00.

*HV1: Okay, so sometimes do you get to see her when—

*PAR2: The only time I get to see her if she calls up to the job, daddy, bring me home a taco and she sit
up and wait for that taco.

*HV1: Oh, nice, nice. That’s sweet of you after a long night of work.

*PAR2: Sometimes I forget on purpose.

*HV1: Yeah. That is completely understandable. I would probably forget many times. So, right now,
Child C is showing (Home Visitor) some of her favorite books like I mentioned to you so you mentioned
that she gets a lot of her books from the library and then—

*PAR1: From school. Yes.

*HV1: From churches. Are there any other places that she gets—

*PAR1: I have to go like what’s the um, goodwill and find books. If she find little books in thee too.

*HV1: Yeah. Very nice. So what, if anything do you do when Child C has a hard time with a book? She
comes to you and she says, I can’t read this.

*PAR1: She sits with me. She sits with me.

*HV1: Okay, can you tell me a little bit about what you do with her when she comes to you?

*PAR1: I tell her like sound out the word first and if she can’t do it, I say it for her or he’ll say it for her.

*HV1: Is there anything else that you would do when she comes and she’s like this book is too hard. I
can’t read this book?

*PAR1: She just don’t read it. She look at the pictures.

*HV1: Yeah, so you tell her to look at the pictures.

*PAR1: She look at the pictures and try to figure out what the story is.

*HV1: Nice, that’s wonderful. So what are some questions that you ask when you talk about like the
books that she’s read?

*PAR1: What she like about it. What she think about it, because sometimes she puts herself in the
story.

*HV1: Yeah. Yeah. Those are great questions. Okay. So what, if anything do you do to get Child C to
want to read more? Is there anything that you have found really that gets her excited about reading?

*PAR1: We can’t even get the girl to sit still.

*HV1: really? So she likes to be moving and playing?

*PAR1: Um-hum.

*HV1: Okay.

*PAR1: She don’t sit still long enough to read anything.

*HV1: Okay. Do you find that sometimes she has an easier time to sit down and read it if it’s
something that’s interesting to her?

*PAR1: It’s just getting to where she’ll sit still.

*HV1: Hopefully, we’ll get to send some books that we’ll get and that will help you guys to keep her
seated a little bit.

*PAR2: She’s a busy bee.

*HV1: That’s a good thing. I think she’s smart. Makes your job as parents a little harder. So are there
any other people in the home that she reads with or reads too?

*PAR2: No.

*HV1: So primarily just the two of you?

*PAR1: Um-hum.

*HV1: Great. And so how do you know when Child C’s done a good job reading a book?

*PAR1: She, I will treat her like candy or when we go out somewhere.

*HV1: Okay. And so how would you describe Child C’s reading skills right now?

*PAR2: They are below average.

*HV1: Oh, below average, is that what you said?

*PAR2: Um-hum.

*HV1: Okay, so tell me more about what you mean.

*PAR2: Anything that’s not a Dr. Seuss, she has a hard time reading.

*HV1: Okay. So those are just her favorites, everything else is-, nice. Great. Okay, are you guys done?

*HV1: Not quite, okay, so I just have a couple more questions. Are there any goals that you have for
Child C for reading this summer that we can possibly help with or just that you have for her?

*PAR1: I ___I don’t even let her go outside that often, so it would be good for her to have these books.

*HV1: Nice. Great. That’s wonderful. Thank you so much for sitting down with me and telling me
about this. Hopefully, we can get some really good books for her to read and then keep her sitting for a
little while.

*PAR2: Yes.

*HV1: This is a lot of good books. I hope it’s not going to be that hot today. It has been unbelievable
the past two days. I don’t know what’s going on.

*open-ended interview*
*HV1: We're interested in knowing the kind of things you and your third grader do in your everyday
routine, so tell me about a typical day for Child S from morning to bedtime as well as you can remember.

*PAR:
Gets up -- well she's got to be at school by 8:00 so her school day is typically
from 8:00 to 4:00. And then after school she has violin lessons. And then if she's not at violin lessons
then she's at afterschool, and the days she doesn't go to afterschool she'll come home, I'll tell her to
take a break because she's already had that full day of school, "Go play with your friends," so she'll go
play with her friends down the street for about an hour and then she'll come home, do her homework,
have dinner, take a bath. We read for 45 minutes and then typically she'll be in bed by 8:30 because
she's got to get up so early that if her body doesn't get the rest it needs it's ______________ fall asleep
at school.

*HV1: We're interested in learning more about your child's books and reading interests. Child S is
showing (Home visitor) some books right now; where did you get most of her books, so from the school
library, from public library, did you buy them, did someone else give them to her?

*PAR:
A lot of her books that she's chosen is from the public library. Most of her
books -- if she has a book fair at her school I'll buy her a book, but the majority of her books come from
the public library.

*HV1: What are some things that you do to help your child become a good reader?

*PAR:
Just tell her reading is important because it's language, it's English, it's words,
and you're not going to be able to understand sentences of words if you're not reading. When you're at
school and you're writing that's words because you have to understand what the teacher is saying and if
reading helps you in your spelling -- she's a good speller so I'm like if you like words reading should be a
part of your everyday -- I push that because I feel with Child S if she's a reader and you slow her down
and she takes a break that is sometimes a lot harder when you take that long break to go back to
reading, so I'm like, "Child S, you know, if you read for 30 minutes a day you read for 40 minutes a day
it's reading. It's still words that you know and if you like to do it don't stop."

*HV1: So what, if anything, do you do when your child has a hard time with a book?

*PAR:
I usually tell her to sound the word out. If she's reading a book and she doesn't
understand the word I'm, "Child S, sound it out. It's like spelling: if you don't know how to spell a word
just sound out the word and break the word down so you can understand the word." I'm, "Child S, you
can also look in the dictionary if you're at school if you don't understand the word because they tell you
what the word means or ask your teacher." Sometimes you'll see a child getting frustrated over a word
and it's just to tell the child, "Take it, just break the word down and do it as slow as you can because if
you ignore it [crosstalk." I just let Child S -- reassure her that, "Don't get frustrated over a word because
sometimes you're not going to get -- sometimes I don't get words, I mean sometimes I have to break
words down just to know what the word means." I tell her to do that and she understands it better.

*HV1: What are some questions you ask your child when you talk about books she has read?

*PAR:
I'll ask her about the story. I'll ask her what happened in the story, who are the
people or characters in the story and what were they doing and what were they doing to make you want
to ask the question, like if you read a story and it's telling you about two people that went to a store and
did whatever they're like, "What did they do at the store? What did they get at the store? Was it a
story that they paid for something and they had to get some money back? What happened in the story?
Did the little child get lost in the story?" It's like I make her think. _____ not just reading the story; it's
making you think about what you just read because you can read something and be like -- I don't want
you to be like, "Okay, I read it," and put it down because then you're not really understanding what you
read as far as the story.

*HV1: What, if anything, do you do to motivate your child to read?

*PAR:
We have stories and stuff, books to read I be like, "If you read a certain amount
of books on a Friday I'll take you to go get some ice cream, or I'll take you to the doll store. If you want
to go pick something out it's like I have this for you but you have to read first. I'm not just going to give
you it and then you're half reading it or stuff like that.

*HV1: Sounds good. Are there other people in your home that help your child with reading?

*PAR:
My oldest likes to read but when her grandma comes to visit her she'll sit down
with Child S and they'll read and talk about what they read and all. I hear them laughing so I know
they're having a good time with whatever they were reading. Then she's like, "No mommy, it's
grandma's and my time right now," so I'm like -- it's like, "I'm going to give you that time, okay."

*HV1: How do you know if your child has done a good job reading a book?

*PAR:
Because I see her laugh, I see her get excited about the story that she's read. I
know she likes what she's reading because she'll ask me are there any more books like what I've just
read. Okay, the library had a whole series of Diamond Princess stories or something and Child S read
one and then she read a couple more and then she went to the library and she was like, "Do you have
any more?" and the librarian was like, "We don't have any more of that story but there's other like it
that you might want to read." So Child S was like, "Okay." Then she read the back of it and stated to
read a couple page and then was like, "Okay, I don't want to finish reading the story."

*HV1: So what makes a good third grade reader?

*PAR:
Someone who likes reading, who's enthusiastic about what they're reading, who
gets excited about reading. Because some kids don't like to read. Some kids just if they read enough in
school they don't want to go home and have to do any more reading. So I try to tell Child S, "Reading is
you're learning about different stories, different adventures." You might pick a book where there's like
a pirate story, you might pick a book where there's a mermaid story and you might really like to hear
more about it, but if you don't want to read it you're not going to know about it and I can't tell you
about it. Because I might have read the book and I'll say to Child S, "Okay, I read it." And _____ say,
"What it's about?" I'm like, "You have to read it. Like I'll help you reading it so you can understand the
story and like the story but I'm not going to read for you because you're not getting anything out of it if I
do."

*HV1: And what should a good reader be able to do?

*PAR:
Understand the information and know that whatever they're reading they like
what they're reading and it's not boring to them because kids get bored quick and to keep their
attention sometime you have to have a book that you know that's going to keep their attention or their
just not going to want to read it. And with her when she finds something that she likes to read she'll sit
there and read it. She'll just take the book and read it herself. I know she likes reading and I know it's
helped her a lot just being more outgoing because then she gets her other friends like, "This is a book I
read," then she'll tell them about the story and they'll want to read the story and it just made her more
outgoing.

*HV1: How would you describe your child's reading skills?

*PAR:
Well the way their school was 40 was high in reading; she scored like about you
know, like about a 40 so her reading was like off the charts with her reading and that's because -- and

her teacher said she likes to read and I said, "Yes, she likes to read, she likes to write stories," and she
said, "That's good," and I said, "It's better sometimes when your child likes something than when they
don't because then they won't really learning anything." And you see the change in your child and they
want to go to the library or they want to go to the bookstore. I mean if I take her to the Barnes &
Nobles I can't find my child because she's already in the kids' section, sitting on the floor, has a book
already and the lady was like, "Wow," and I'm like, "Because that's what she likes to do," she's like, "Not
many kids come in there -- most kids that come in there want to like run around and start playing with
stuff." And I'm like, "No, I could leave her right here and go two aisles over and she'll be right here on
the floor, still reading the same book that she picked up.

*HV1: And what goals do you have for your child's reading this summer?

*PAR:
I'd like to see Child S just continue her reading and like if it brings out her
personality more that's what I want to see. I don't want Child S to just stop reading just because
school's over with. I want to know that reading is something that Child S wants to continue doing. I like
the fact that she likes reading, she's interested, she asks questions. If it's keeping her mind interested
__________, then she'd be bored.

*open-ended interview*
*HV1: Okay. So the next set of questions, we’re interested in knowing the kinds of things you and your
third grader do in your every day routine. So tell me about a typical day for Child Y from morning to
bedtime as well as you can remember.

*PAR: Well, morning sometimes is a struggle. Bedtime sometimes is a struggle. Doesn’t want to go to
bed. Doesn’t want to get up. MM. I don’t know. I’m gonna let grandma explain that one.

*PAR2: What was it?

*PAR: How is her typical day for Child Y?

*HV1: Her typical every day routine from morning to bedtime.

*PAR2: Well, when she gets up she usually – she likes to drag in the morning. She doesn’t like to just
get up and start doing something. She will lie in bed and just lie there or either she’ll come get in bed
with me.

*PAR: To go from her bed to grandma’s bed.

*PAR2: We’ll talk for a while. Then she wants something to eat. And she’s kind of picky about what she
wants to eat. She usually wants what she wants. And so she has a different menu that she eats, but
that’s what she wants to eat. After she eats she’s basically ____ the TV. And if we’re going somewhere,
TV has to go off and get dressed and leave. Generally we’re going somewhere. And she comes home
after – if we come back from wherever we go. TV pops on. She’s a snacker. So she loves to snack a lot.

*PAR: Little nibbler. Yes.

*PAR2: And somewhere in there we can put some chores. She’s supposed to do something every day,
but that doesn’t get done every time. So generally eat some dinner. After dinner, if she feels like – she
doesn’t want to go to bed. She never wants to go to bed. So she’ll use the excuse, but I didn’t eat

enough. I’m hungry. I'm still hungry. Can I eat some more? So naturally that’s more time so we can eat
something else and then –

*PAR: To stay up longer.

*PAR2: Finally go take a shower and go to bed.

*HV1: So we’re interested in learning more about your child’s books and reading interests. And right
now she’s in there showing (home visitor) some books. Where did you get most of her books? So from
the school library, public library, did you buy them for her, did someone else give them to her or did the
school give them to her?

*PAR: I was gonna say it’s kind of in between all of that. Pretty much the library, the school library.

*HV1: So if you had to think about most of the books she has.

*PAR: Most of them were bought.

*HV1: Bought.

*PAR: Yeah. Most of them were bought.

*HV1: And what are some things that you do to help Child Y become a good reader?

*PAR: Say that one more time.

*HV1: What are some things that you do to help her become a good reader?

*PAR: Um. She really doesn’t need any help. Like she grabs hold to the phonics thing at like the age of
five. She was reading exceptionally well from like that point up till now. So she’s always read above her

level without any I guess promotion, whatever. We didn’t have to – that was like a natural. She didn’t
really need too much encouragement or anything.

*HV1: Okay.

*PAR: She actually likes it. She likes to read. My oldest too.

*PAR2: That’s because I put books in front of them from the time they were small.

*PAR: They were babies. They had the touch and feel books. Grandma’s a art teacher. So grandma –
anything educational they’re gonna get it. No way around it.

*PAR2: And I put like things in their vision. Stuck things on the wall so they could see the alphabet, so
they could see colors. So they could see – I mean just become familiar. And so it was just easy for them
because they knew they were gonna read. It wasn’t ever a chore. It wasn’t ever anything hard to do.

*PAR: Nm mm.

*PAR2: I put it to them when they were babies. And they just grew up with them.

*HV1: Okay. So what, if anything, do you do when she has a hard time with a book? Which I think you
kind of answered that but.

*PAR: She really don’t.

*PAR2: if she does, sometimes if she doesn’t want to – sometimes if maybe she’s sleepy or tired or
whatever and she’s, ___ _____. And I’ll say, _____ ______. Just try it again. If you look at it again, the
question you were just asking me is right there. So just kind of reinforce going back over it. Go back
over it. Look. And then or either I will tell her to stop. Just take a time out. Just leave it alone and put it
down. Close the book. We’re not even gonna discuss it until she cleans up that little attitude. And then
she’ll come back and say, “Is that all it was?” Yeah, that’s all it was. It was you were your own _____.

*HV1: And what are some questions that you ask Child Y when you talk about books that she has read?

*PAR: Basically what was the book about. What did you think it was about? Pretty much just things
like that.

*HV1: Okay. And I think we’ll have the answer to this one. Are there other people in your home that
help your child with reading?

*PAR: [Laughter] This is actually, we’re like mommy and daddy. So this is ____ are grandma’s babies.
That’s not just a saying. These are grandma’s babies. Only these two. And she’s got, what? Fifteen?

*PAR2: Fourteen.

*PAR: Fourteen. I only have two.

*HV1: So what does she do to help?

*PAR: Grandma does everything to help. Grandma does everything. Anything they need help with.
But they – I’m not gonna say they. We’re talking about Child Y. Child Y, as far as reading?

*HV1: Mm hmm.

*PAR: She really doesn’t get stumped or need like help or anything extra with reading.

*HV1: So she’s support.

*PAR: Mm hmm. Pretty much. That’s ____ _____. Yeah. That support system. But other than that
she’s a-okay with reading.

*HV1: And how do you know if your child has done a good job reading a book?

*PAR2: She’s usually excited –

*PAR: I was gonna say, yeah, she’ll talk about it. She’ll talk about it. Or she’ll read it again. Like she
did with the stripes.

*PAR2: Oh, god. Stripes and Amelia Bedelia.

*PAR: Yes. Yes, yes, yes. And Junie B. Jones.

*PAR2: Yes.

*PAR: Yeah. She was reading Junie B. Jones books at probably the age of six. Maybe six. And they’re
chapter books. So she was at six she was reading those. So yeah, she’s always been exceptional.

*HV1: And what makes a good third grade reader?

*PAR: An ambitious reader. And that’s what she is.

*HV1: And what should a good reader be able to do?

*PAR: Reading comprehend. I think. I don’t know if that’s too old for a third grader to do but. No,
that’s actually what she had her EOGs on today. No, it was yesterday it was reading comprehension.

*PAR2: Yesterday.

*PAR: She said today we did the – what did you take today? Your EOGs. Which one did you?

*CHI:

_____ active.

*PAR: Calculator active. That was the word.


01-ATK
*From open-ended interview*

*HV1: Okay. Great. Well, that is the first third of my questions. Let me just. Okay. So now we’ll just
ask you a series of open ended questions. So we are interested in knowing the kinds of things that you
and Child K do in your every day routine. So if you were to think about a typical day for her, from the
time she wakes up to the time she goes to bed, can you walk me through that?

*PAR: Mm hmm. She gets up at 6:12 every morning. Well, weekday.

*HV1: Six twelve?

*PAR: Mm hmm. Cause I have to be to work at 7:00. So she gets up, get dressed. I take her to her
grandmother’s house by 6:40. She eat breakfast. Then she go back to sleep until her school bus come.
And that’s about 8:15. And she go to school. She was going after school tutoring until 6:15. So I pick
her up from there. She come home. Eat. Most of the time her homework was done. She’ll look at a
little TV, take a shower and she’s in bed by 9:00.

*HV1: Okay. Great. Thank you. And we’re interested in learning more about her books and her
reading interests. And she’s gonna show Ms. (Home Visitor) some of her books in a minute. But our
question for you is where did you get most of her books from?

*PAR: My oldest daughter.

*HV1: Okay. So they’ve been passed down.

*PAR: Yeah. We just saved. Mm hmm.

*HV1: How old are your other daughters?

*PAR: Twenty-one and 18.

*HV1: Okay. That’s nice that you didn’t throw them away.

*PAR: I didn’t. And they just cleaned the shelves out, so I’m not even really sure where they put them.
But they’re in here somewhere.

*HV1: And where did you get those books a –

*PAR: I bought them from like the book fairs at school. I bought them from there.

*HV1: Great. And what are some things that you do to help Child K become a good reader?

*PAR: I always encourage her that reading is fundamental and educational. You learn more – if you
read more, you learn more.

*HV1: Okay. And what, if anything, do you do when you see that she’s having a hard time with a book?

*PAR: I sit there and help her.

*HV1: Okay. What does that look like for you?

*PAR: It’s fun to me. Yeah, cause I feel like I’m helping her.

*HV1: What specific tasks might you do to help her?

*PAR: I’ll help her pronounce the words. And then when she do not understand a story, I’ll tell her to
start from the beginning on what she remembers and then we kind of like backtrack if she doesn’t
understand.

*HV1: Okay. What are some questions that you ask her when you talk to her about books that she has
read?

*PAR: What was it about. And that’s really about it. I just want her to explain to me what did she read
to make sure that she did read –

*HV1: Just getting a recap, right?

*PAR: Yeah.

*HV1: Yep. And what, if anything, do you do to motivate her to read?

*PAR: I give her surprises.

*HV1: Okay. So little incentives.

*PAR: I’ll take – yeah.

*HV1: Okay. And are there other people in the home that help her with reading?

*PAR: No. Not really. Nm mm.

*HV1: Okay. And how do you know if she has done a good job of reading a book?

*PAR: She can explain it to me.

*HV1: That’s what I keep hearing from parents. And what do you think makes a good third grade
reader? What should they be able to do?

*PAR: I just think they should be able to read clearly and understand what they’re reading.
Comprehend what they’re reading.

*HV1: Okay. Okay. And how would you describe Child K’s reading skills?

*PAR: I think they’re good.

*HV1: Okay. And what goals do you have for her reading this summer?

*PAR: I just want her to stay focused on school. Keep reading. Because I feel if over the summer she
doesn’t do anything, then she’ll lose or forget what she was taught in school.

*HV1: Well, you have come to the right program. Because that is the entire mission of this program is
we know, the research shows that kids loose gains over the summertime. And so our goal by keeping
them engaged with books is to make sure they’re not losing that. So I am just delighted to hear that
that’s your goal, cause that’s our goal too. Well, you are just incredibly, you know concise yet succinct
and those are all my questions for you.

*PAR: Oh, okay.


01-ACI
*open-ended interview*
*HV1: First one, we’re interested in knowing the kinds of things that you and Child L do in a typical day,
so if you were to think about her routine from the time she gets up to the time she goes to bed, can you
walk me through that?
*PAR: She gets up at about 7:30 AM. She takes about ten minutes in the bathroom to brush her teeth
and wash her face. Then she gets dressed. Then she comes and she eats breakfast, watches a little bit
of TV. Most of the time she doesn’t know because she’s eager to get to the bus stop.
We’ll get in the car. I’ll take her to the bus stop. We’ll wait for the bus. The bus comes at 8:30 on the
dot, typically. She goes to school, her whole school routine. Once she gets home, just going off of what
I’ve seen, she gets home.
She’s telling us about her day. She has a snack. She goes to take a bath because I don’t want her sitting
around in her clothes that she’s wore at school all day, so she takes a bath, and then as soon as she
takes a bath, she’ll either have another snack or she’ll start on her homework while dinner is being
prepared. If she finishes her homework, she’ll eat dinner. She’ll read and then we’ll go over her
homework and her reading assignment. Then she goes to bed.
*HV1: Okay, and what time does she go to bed about?
*PAR: Oh, Lord, 9:00, if not 8:30.
*HV1: Okay, great, and we’re really interested in learning more about what kinds of things she likes to
read about. I know that right now she’s probably showing (Home Visitor) some of her books and our
question for you, and you’ve already talked about this a little, but I’ll ask again. Where did you get most
of her books from?
*PAR: Most of the ones that she has right now are Dollar Tree.
*HV1: Okay, that’s a good deal. I’ve seen those. Yeah, and what are some things that you do to help
her become a good reader?
*PAR: Have her dissect the word, to pronounce it, to understand what it is. If she doesn’t understand
what it is, I will give her the definition of it and use it in a sentence for her and show her how she can
use it in her daily living. I actually have her to stand up and read. For me, ____ _____ read, just leisurely
reading to help her get the words right and then her second read, which I’ll have her read it again so she
can read it fluently, she has to stand and read it in front of the family and then explain to us what the
story is about.
*HV1: I really like that. I like how you make it kind of formal and a family event. That’s nice. I really
like that.
*PAR: Then my husband will do a test for her. We’ll write out a test for her so she can actually explain
and to tell what it is, and it was just preparations too for EOG’s and just regular tests and critical thinking
tests, but to write it out so she can explain, so she can learn to not go off in her imagination like she’s

done in the past about a story, but she sticks to the format of the story and gives the answer to the
story, whatever the question is asked, and give a detailed answer as to what’s going on.
*HV1: Okay. Great and next question. What, if anything, do you do when you see that she’s having a
hard time with a book?
*PAR: Tell her to leave and relax. Get a snack. Have some fun. Get her mind off of it, and when she’s
ready, come back.
*HV1: Okay.
*PAR: And try it again.
*HV1: Okay, great. Take a break. Number five, you’re already talked about this. What are some
questions that you ask her when you talk to her about books that she’s read?
*PAR: One of the questions would be, what is the setting?
*HV1: Okay.
*PAR: Who are the main characters in the book? What is the story talking about? Where was the
climax at, and what happened in the end, or specific questions related to the characters in the book.
*HV1: Okay, and what, if anything, do you do to motivate her to read?
*PAR: Take her shopping, a shopping spree.
*HV1: She was pretty excited about that gift card. She’s already geared up for the shopping spree.
*PAR: Shopping sprees.
*HV1: Okay, anything else?
*PAR: No. She just likes to shop.
*HV1: Got it. Okay.
*PAR: Shopping sprees or just going to (Name)’s or something, a personal outing. We do family
outings, but she likes personal, one-on-one outings and she likes clothes and she loves jewelry, so she
loves to go to Glitter at the mall and just get all that dollar jewelry that she wants.
*HV1: Is she a girly girl?
*PAR: Oh, definitely. She’s been wearing makeup since she was three.
*HV1: Oh, wow.
*PAR: Yeah.
*HV1: That’s fun (laughter). That’s cute. She’s such a cutie. Oh, it makes me think about my
childhood. You talked about this. Are there other people in the home that help her with reading, and if
so, what do they do to help?

*PAR: It would be her dad, Parent C. What he does is pretty much we’re a united front, so he does the
same thing. We have her initial reading, which pretty much is for a new book or something, just to see
where she is, start off, see if she’s breaking down her words and everything, just pretty much reiterate
dissecting words, slowing her down, and if it’s a long book, if it’s a long chapter book, we’ll just do two
chapters at a time unless the chapters are really long. Try not to exceed the 20 minute or the 30 minute,
for us really, reading timespan and then go back and ask her questions just off of what she’s read alone.
Once she finished the entire chapter book, then we’ll ask her no more than 10 or 12 questions, most of
the time, about the entire book just to make sure that she has the full understanding and if we start a
new book, we’ll ask her about a previous book just to see if she still remembers and is able to retain that
information.
*HV1: Great. Okay, and how do you know if she’s done a good job of reading a book?
*PAR: Because she’s very gung ho about it. She’s wanting to tell you and everybody else about it, to
be quite honest. Just when she’s confident. I know that she feels good about what she’s done when
she’s really, really confident. If she’s being withdrawn or if she feels like, no, I really don’t wanna go
over it then I know that she’s made up some words or whatever. She’s filled in some words, filled in the
blanks of what she didn’t know.
*HV1: Okay.
*PAR: But typically, when she’s gung ho and very excited about it and real confident, I know.
*HV1: Okay.
*PAR: Yeah.
*HV1: Great, and what do you think makes a good third grade reader, so in other words, what should a
good third grade reader be able to do?
*PAR: I think a good third grade reader should definitely be able to go through a chapter book without
no problems, without any headaches, as she call ‘em (laughter), and be able to tell you the beginning,
the middle, and the end of a book and give you some highlighted points and topics, and I think they
should be able to independently read without the assistance of a teacher and/or parent. I think their
comfort level should be at a maximum. I think they should be really, really comfortable with reading
aloud and going over things one-on-one if need be, but I really think they should be a very strong or
okay – I don’t even wanna say a moderate reader. I really think they should just be a strong reader at
that point.
*HV1: Okay.
*PAR: Especially by the end.
*HV1: Okay. Yep, okay, and how would you describe her reading skills?
*PAR: I think her reading skills have drastically improved. I don’t think that she is as strong as I would
want her to be or where I think that she needs to be. I think that she’s okay. I think that she falls into
the average percentile, which is not where I want her to be. I would really want her to be in an above
average range, whereas it’s a thought process, so should she really be in the third grade, going to
fourth?

I would rather it be fourth grade, going to fifth, or something of that nature. I really push her to be the
best that she can be, and I don’t want her to settle and I think that she has settled or pretty much is in
the position to have settled. Quite frankly, I don’t intend for her to continue to go to (X), to be quite
honest. I am not pleased with (Y) schools because she came from (Z).
*HV1: That’s too bad.
*PAR: Oh, yeah.
*HV1: Yeah. She was at (Z). When did she start at (X)?
*PAR: Yeah. She started (X) her second grade year.
*HV1: Okay.
*PAR: Yeah.
*HV1: So are you gonna put her back in (Z)?
*PAR: I am.
*HV1: Okay. Will that start in next fall, this fall?
*PAR: No, because our lease doesn’t end until after school starts, so she’s gonna start back at (X), but
then she’s gonna come out, because it’s year round over there.
*HV1: Okay.
*PAR: Yeah.
*HV1: It doesn’t mean anything coming from me, but I am sorry to hear that.
*PAR: Oh, it’s terrible.
*HV1: I mean that’s your child’s world. That’s your child’s everything, and you wanna have confidence
in those people.
*PAR: I’m not.
*HV1: Goodness. Sorry. Well, final question for you.
*PAR: Okay.
*HV1: What goals do you have for her reading this summer?
*PAR: I want her to become a very strong, independent, confident reader.
*HV1: Okay.
*PAR: That’s what I want.
*HV1: Okay.
*PAR: And that’s my goal. That’s the purpose of me doing this program, because she’s excited about
it. That really helps me a lot where I won’t have to push the issue.

*HV1: That was fun to see.
*PAR: And I think too, since whomever told her about the money, I don't know why they did it. I think
they may have done it just to get kids kind of riled up about it, but it was a plus. It wound up being a
plus according to her, but I really want her to take this seriously, which I believe that she will, because
she is excited about it. It’s nothing that I’m pushing.
*HV1: Yeah, I could tell. She’s like, “When do I get my books?”
*PAR: She’s been looking forward for, I don't know, about a month and a half.
*HV1: Good. Oh, that’s such a long time for a kid.
*PAR: Whenever they sent it out. That’s what she’s been looking forward to ____ ___ ______.
*HV1: They need to give her a start date, so she cannot get too excited.
*PAR: Well, we told her several times it’s not gonna start until you’re out of school, so she’s like, “But
they said! They said!” I’m like, “Who in the world are they?”
I remember sitting here absolutely confused. I know at one point I was actually looking for the books
because I’m like, “When are they?” Then you had started calling, so it shined some light on some things,
but really, I was walking blind there for a minute.
*HV1: Yeah. I know until you got the call, you heard just bits and pieces, so –
*PAR: Oh, yeah.
*HV1: Well, those are all my questions for you. Thank you for taking the time to answer them so
thoughtfully and let me see where they are. There’s some paperwork we can do together. While we
wait. Just let me see.
*PAR: Okay.

*PAR: He’s a good reader, I mean not now but when he first started reading I would sit down with him
and he would read to me, but you know he’s to the point where he understands the words so that’s not
an issue anymore. Now more so it’s just taking him to the library and letting him pick out some books.

him to read.

*PAR: No ‘cause his dad works, and then maybe sometimes his brother might, he might, __________
with his brother, they might help.

*HV1:

Okay, but his brother doesn’t live with him

*PAR:

Now his brother isn’t here.

*HV1: Okay, so we’re just going to say it’s you. And, how do you know if Child P has done a good job of
reading a book?

*PAR: Because he, sometimes he’ll tell me about the book he reads. Yeah. And then mostly now, he
takes his book and give it to my grandson and tells him, sometimes he points to him and tell him what it
is, yeah.

*HV1: So that’s how you know he’s done a good job. And what in your opinion makes a good third
grade reader? So what should they be able to do?

*PAR: Read, be successful in reading _________ when you do, don’t know the word, try to pronounce
it, the syllables, say the syllables until you get it.

*HV1: Great, okay. And how would you describe Child P’s reading skills?

*PAR:

Good.

*HV1: Okay. And what, final question, what goals do you have for his reading this summer?

*PAR: Read more, probably make him write me a story about what he reads, that’s it.

*HV1:

Great, thanks for answering all my questions.

*PAR:

You’re welcome.

*from open-ended interviews
*HV1: So tell me, please, about a typical day for Child S from morning to bedtime as well as you can
remember.

*PAR: During the weekday?

*HV1: Yes, ma’am.

*PAR: I be at work. She get up. I don’t see her until 2:30 when I get off work ‘cause I have to be to
work at 6:00.

*HV1: 6:00 a.m.?

*PAR: Mm-hmm.

*HV1: How would you say that is her typical day?

*PAR: She get up. I call from my job to wake her up at 7:00. Then she get up. Then wash up. Then get
on the bus. Then she go to school. Then she get home about, I want to say about 4:00. She do her
homework. Then she watch TV for a little while. Then she go outside and play. Then about 6:00, 7:00
we eat dinner. Then by 9:45 they take a bath, and they go to bed about 10:00.

*HV1: Busy day, huh?

*PAR: Yeah.

*HV1: We’re also interested in learning about her books and her reading interest. Child S is showing
(Home Visitor) some books right now. Where did she get most of her books from?

*PAR: This lady had gave her a whole bunch of books, one of my friends, and then we go to Wal-Mart
and she buy books. Then, like I said, my daughter take her to the library and she get a book from the
library.

*HV1: Okay. And what are some of the things that you do to help her become a better reader or a
good reader?

*PAR: We try to read every night if I ain’t tired, but if I’m tired, we don’t read.

*HV1: What, if anything, do you do to help her make time for reading?

*PAR: Well, when she get off the school bus, I make sure she do her homework, so she have to read
the worksheets from her homework.

*HV1: And what, if anything, do you do to help her learn the meanings of new words?

*PAR: If she don’t know, we’ll look ‘em up in the dictionary to find the meanings, and then if I can’t
pronounce the word, I have to get my son to help me with ‘em ‘cause I’m not a real strong reader either.
So like the real big words I don’t know, I get my son to help me with those.

*HV1: And what, if anything, do you do to help her to understand what she reads?

*PAR: We’ll sit down. We’ll try to talk about it until she get frustrated, and then she don’t be wantin’
to do it no more.

*HV1: What, if anything, do you do when she has a hard time with a book?

*PAR: We might try to read it a couple times and then after that I just tell her to find another book.

*HV1: Just find another book?

*PAR: Yeah.

*HV1: Okay. And what are some of the questions that you ask her when you talk about books that she
reads?

*PAR: I ask her about the main character of the book, and then we’ll talk about what the person done.
And say like Sue and John went downtown. Then Sue bought him some candy, so I ask her, “How much
did the candy cost,” and, “Why did she buy him the candy,” and stuff.

*HV1: And what do you do, if you do anything, to motivate her to read?

*PAR: Try to read with her.

*HV1: Okay. Are there other people in your home that help her with reading?

*PAR: My daughter and my son.

*HV1: Your daughters. How old are they?

*PAR: My daughter’s 25, and my son is 20.

*HV1: And they live here?

*PAR: Yep. Yeah. That’s the other little girl mama that’s here.

*HV1: Right, right, right, right. And what do they do to help her, if you know what they do?

*PAR: They try to help her with the words she don’t know, like the real big words she don’t know.
Until she start aggravating them. Then they won’t help her. Say like you’re reading with her, she’ll read
for a minute, and then she just go off the wall, like just lose focus and won’t pay attention. And then

you got to keep calling her name to make her to get back into the book. Then if she don’t do it, after
while they just don’t help her.

*HV1: Okay. How do you know if she’s doing a good job reading a book?

*PAR: If she could tell me more than two things that happened after we read the story, I feel like she
did a pretty good job.

*HV1: Okay. And what do you think makes a good third grade reader?

*PAR: I don’t know. What make a good reader? First, you gotta pay attention, and you’re gonna have
to want to read. I mean you just can’t just throw the book there and tell ‘em to read. The person gonna
have to want to read, I guess. So I couldn’t tell you.

*HV1: All right. You’re doing a good job. And how would you describe her reading skills right now?

*PAR: I’d say she’s pretty average. Before she got transferred to the school she at now, I think her
reading level was four, and I think it dropped since she been over here to Elementary.

*HV1: Four from – what’s the scale here? Like one to five, one to ten?

*PAR: Oh, I don’t know what the scale is they go by, but they had level one, two, three, four, and I
think she was on level four when she left (School).

*HV1: And which one is the maximum? Like is it one or five?

*PAR: Oh, I don’t know the maximum, but I know before she left (School), she was a level four reader.
I don’t know what her reading level is at on (Elementary).

*HV1: Okay. Thanks a lot. That’s about it for this activity.


01_AGK
*Open-ended interview*
*HV1: Good. And that’s it for you. We’re gonna wait until – these are the questions that I ask you if
you want to keep them. We are going to wait for them. _____ _____ _____. And then you are gonna
ask her about what she read and you’re gonna learn how to use the tape recorder.

You are a busy girl. Do you have two boys?

*PAR: Yes. He’s 10 and my oldest is 15. He doesn’t exist outside of his room and his laptop. He stays
pretty much in his room with his computer. And so it’s really hard. You know you see him leaving for
school and see him come in. He knows the smell of food. He comes to get his dinner.

*HV1: ____ _______ ______ I need money.

*PAR: Right. Right. ____ ______. Every once in a while. But he sustains himself for the most part. I
don’t really have to – you know we cook dinner. We try to eat together ______ home. But, you know
he does his own laundry. He cleans up behind himself. And I try to do that with all of them to make
them self-sufficient. You know especially with the fact that I spend a lot of time at work. I work
between 40 and 45 hours a week. So in retail. So it’s kind of, you know even when I get home.

*HV1: Tiring and busy.

*PAR: Right. When I get home I’m done, you know. I don’t really have much energy. When I work in
the evenings, you know they’re already – they’re in school when I leave. And they’re usually in bed by
the time I get back home. So I don’t get to see a lot of them during the week. And my Saturday I work
11 hours Saturday. I work 10:30 to 9:30 on Saturdays and I go back to work at 8:30 on Sunday. So it’s
like most of the weekend I’m at work.

*HV1: What kind of things do you do to help her out when she has difficulty with a book?

*PAR: __ _____ like sound them out. And she actually has little phrases that I’ve given her. Like when
there are two consonants next to each other, two vowels next to each other the first one does the
talking, the second one does the walking. So she can figure out how to sound it out. Or I’ll tell her, you
know listen to herself and if she’s having a hard time figuring it out, you know I’ll ask her does that

sound like a real word or does that sound like a word that you’ve heard before. If she hasn’t, I’ll tell her,
well, you know try sounding it out again until she figures out what it is and then I’ll _____okay, do you
think that’s the real word or is that how it’s supposed to sound? And __ _____. And then we do some
activities on the computer out of the like phonics activities on the computer. Different websites. ___
____ ______ the school level. And you know how to give her some tips on how to figure out or how to
____ ____. For the most part, I do the same thing I learned in elementary school when I was coming up.
To try to sound it letter by letter until you get it, you know. Figure it out.

*HV1: What kind of questions do you ask her after she reads a book?

*PAR: What it was about. Who was the main character. Things like how it ended. Because then I
know she read the whole thing. She likes to tell you about the beginning of a book, you know. I ask her
how it ended. I ask her to tell me something about what happened leading up – like a series of events
leading up to the ending. And I notice that she likes a lot of realistic things. Like, you know history or a
story that has some ___ to being true. So I’ll ask her like how does she think it would happen now or
what does she think she would have done if she was there. You know. Things like that. Like I said, she
loves history. Especially _____.

*HV1: What do you do to motivate her to read?

*PAR: I don’t really have to do a lot of motivation really. Honestly. All three of them ask for books.
They ask to go to the library constantly. They look for – you know they look up specific books on the
computer, something like that. And they’ll ask for it. The Bone books is one of their favorites. And we
actually have started working on getting them the whole series. I think it's ten books. Ten books, Child
J? I think it’s –

[Cross Talk]

That’s the oldest. But, you know I don’t really have to do a lot to get them to read.

*HV1: Great. That’s amazing.

*PAR: - come from a family of readers.

*HV1: That’s awesome. And anybody else besides you to help her with her readings or motivate her or
do things around books?

*PAR: My husband.

*HV1: Your husband. Good.

*PAR: He’s pretty much the same ______. _____ ____ _____.

*HV1: How do you know that she did a good job reading a book?

*PAR: I ask her about it. ____ different questions ____ _______. You know. Like I said about how the
book was, what the series of events that happened in the book. How it ended. Things like that. And if
she can’t answer or she can’t figure out what it was, then I’ll have her go back and read that portion
again. Most of the time that’s done for school work. But I’ll have her go back and read it again until she
can tell me. If there are questions on her worksheet or whatever that she can’t answer, instead of me
letting use the process of elimination, which she likes to do, I’ll make her go back and find that specific
sentence and then tell me okay, what the answer is ______.

*HV1: Great. What do you think it makes a third grader good reader?

*PAR: I would say it’s multifaceted with phonics, retention, like understanding what they read, and
their ability to relay what they read to another person. If you can explain it, then you know they
understudied it for themselves and they can ______ ______ doing a pretty good job of reading it
themselves.

*HV1: How would you describe her skills as a reader?

*PAR: I believe her skills as a reader are lower than many _____ ____ _____ could be. And we work
together on that. We’ve been working together on that for a while. But like I said, I think what ___ does
is a lot of times she anticipates what it’s gonna say but she doesn’t actually read what it says. And I have
to get on her about, you know don’t say what you think it’s about to say. That’s why we went with
some of the books that don’t have pictures. And I started giving her some chapter books. Because she
can’t look at the picture and say, oh, the cat and the dog were blah, blah, blah. She has to actually read

and see what’s happening. And with the Amelia Bedelia books and the Junie B. books, you know there’s
one lead picture. But she really can’t tell what’s going on from that picture. She has to read to find out.
So.

*HV1: Good.

*PAR: We started on that.

*HV1: What are your goals during the summer for her in reading?

*PAR: I would like to increase her reading level. Actually beyond her school requirements. It’s always
my goal to get them to be better than expected. Or be more than expected. And Child J, he’s a big
brother. He works with her too. He’s an AIG student. He’s in William and Mary’s curriculum. So a lot of
times he’ll share with her his work and try to challenge her, you know to get to what he’s doing. He’s
going to fifth grade.

*HV1: Awesome. That’s wonderful.

*PAR: And they play games and quiz each other, especially in math. They quiz each other. You know
what is such and such and stuff like that. It helps out because when I’m not or her dad’s not available,
she’s got them two. And, you know they’re actually harder on her than we are. Cause they’re her
peers. But I believe that she absorbs better too from them than she does us. A lot of times with kids
whatever comes out of your parent’s mouth doesn’t make sense _____ ______. But with them, you
know she listens _____.

*HV1: Yeah. Yeah. It’s fun.

*PAR: Right.

*HV1: She’s the youngest.

*PAR: Right.

*HV1: Must be fun.

*PAR: She’s the baby. Yeah.

[Cross Talk]

*PAR: That’s what they were doing, eating dinner. But she wanted –

*HV1: We all _____. We all _____.

*HV2: Yep. We’re getting to the last part.

*HV1: They had their own thing so.

[Cross Talk]

*PAR: He works really mostly with ______. Creating music and anime and learning computer
programming.

*HV1: So are you into computers then for college? My son was too. In by your age. But then he
switched to history and then to psychology. He end up in education.

*PAR: See, I went to college and I was a biology major. And then when I came home – I didn’t finish,
but when I came home I ended up becoming an accountant.

*HV1: Ah huh accountant.

*PAR: - anything close to _____. It was so funny. I never realized how much I liked numbers. And
then, you know I started out doing taxes and went from taxes to bookkeeping and to accounts
receivable and all. And I was like, I like numbers better. I still like science, but I like numbers better than
science.

*HV1: Numbers and science.
*Other coded excerpts from home visit*
*HV1: What are some of the favorite things that you do with her?
*PAR: I _____ race with the word finds. Let me race with you. Who can finish the puzzles first. Or who
can find the word first. We did it together. And, you know try to find the word first. We play a game
called dots. You make squares around the name and try to do that.
*
PAR: we’ll read separate books together but not, you know the same book. And then we’ll swap and I’ll
ask her to tell me what she read and I tell her about what I read. And then we also do – there’s a game
where I like have them to find an article and read the article but they only get about five minutes. You
know. And then what I do – I read all of them, but I have them read it. And then afterwards they have
to summarize the article to me. And when they finish, I should understand what the article’s about
without having read it.
*
*PAR: she reads every day. She has to read every day between 20 and 45 minutes for her class. So even
though I don’t have to know what the book is or the teacher assigns the book, I’ll ask her about it so she
can’t just write it down and say, you know I read it. I’ll ask her what the book was about or just tell me
one thing. Or I’ll open it and choose a sentence somewhere in the book and ask her to tell me what that
part of the book was about so I can read over it quickly and see if she actually read. I think one of the
issues that Child A has is she reads but not necessarily retains sometimes. It’s just like, you know going
over it –
*
*HV1: And how often do you talk with Child A about the readings? Never or once or twice a month,
once or twice a week or almost every day.
*PAR: I’m gonna say at least once or twice a week. Cause that’s one of my concerns is her reading. She,
like I said, she reads but sometimes she doesn’t retain. I’m trying to work with her on being able to
answer questions about it for the worksheets that they give. To actually read with understanding what’s
going on so that later on she can answer a question without having to refer back to the _____ ____.


01-ADM
*From open-ended interview*
*HV1: So here with me – might be in here. Yes. Okay, so my first question, we’re interested in doing
the kinds of things that you and Child M do in your everyday routine, so I want you to just think about a
typical day for Child M from the time she wakes up to the time she goes to bed, and maybe just tell me
about it as best you can remember.
*PAR: Okay. Well, when she gets up in the morning, she gets prepared because we have to take her
older brother to school, and she rides with me every morning to do that. Then we come back and she
either sits down and read a book because she’s already ______ herself. She just sits down and read a
book or she might look at MTV, and she eats breakfast here or most of the time she wants to eat it at
school, and she waits for the bus.
Then I go to work when I have to work, and I pick them up from school when they don’t catch the bus.
We come home, and I never have to remind her about getting to her homework. Like I said, she’s very
excited about learning, so she comes home and she starts on her homework or if she doesn’t have a lot
of homework, she’ll read. Then of course she’s back to the TV before she goes to bed.
*HV1: Okay.
*PAR: And of course we eat dinner in between that time.
*HV1: Okay, great. That’s a helpful layout of her routine. The next question, we’re interested in
learning more about Child M’s books and her reading interests, and I know that right now she’s showing
Margaret some of her books and what we wanna know is where did she get most of her books from?
*PAR: Well, we don’t get it from the library. She gets it of course when they have a book fair at school
or they send a paper home. They can order them. A lot of it we get from secondhand stores. We had a
few from bookstores, but because they’re so expensive –
*HV1: Oh, they’re so expensive.
*PAR: Yeah. A lot of times we get them from used bookstores or either secondhand stores, so she has
a lot.
*HV1: Okay, so she ____ ______ helpful _______.
*PAR: Oh, my god. She has at least five boxes of books.
*HV1: Oh, okay (laughter).
*PAR: You see the bookcases.
*HV1: I do, yes.
*PAR: They have them all over the house and a lot of them up here on mine, but she has so many
books.
*HV1: I can tell that you’re an avid reader. I was admiring all of your books.

*PAR: Yeah, and a lot of times people give her books.
*HV1: Okay. Who gives her books?
*PAR: Giving her a lot of books, teachers.
*HV1: Teachers?
*PAR: Teachers, friends. It’s like she’s always been given books.
*HV1: Great.
*PAR: Yeah.
*HV1: Okay, and what are some things that you do to help Child M become a good reader?
*PAR: Well, we don’t spend as much time reading together, like you said, because she’s older, but
before, of course I sat down and read with her and I made sure she understood the importance of really
understanding what she read and not just breezing through it. She mispronounced a word. I would help
her on how to say it correctly and just making sure she really understands what she’s reading.
*HV1: Okay.
*PAR: Because sometimes she could read the words but she doesn’t quite understand, and I was
taught when I was in school, you should understand what you read, so I tried to stress that importance
to my kids.
*HV1: That’s great.
*PAR: Actually understand what it is you’re reading.
*HV1: Okay, and what, if anything, do you do when you see that she’s having a hard time with a book?
*PAR: We would not get off that sentence or that paragraph until we did all of what I just said for
______ how to understand or pronounce the word right. Pretty much that.
*HV1: Okay, and what are some questions that you ask her when you talk about books that she’s read.
*PAR: I always ask her, okay, what was the book about? Did you understand it? Did you like it? Was it
hard?
*HV1: Okay, and what, if anything, do you do to motivate her to read?
*PAR: I really don’t have to with her.
*HV1: I was gonna guess that.
*PAR: I never really had to motivate her to read.
*HV1: She sounds very self-motivated.
*PAR: She always wanted to.
*HV1: And let me just see where they’re at before I proceed. (Home Visitor), how are you doing?

*CHI:

Good.

*HV1: Good. How much? Where y’all at?
*HV2: We just did the book. She’s about to bring the nine books.
*HV1: The nine books? Okay, cool.
*HV2: Yes.
*HV1: Okay, so they’ve got a little bit more time, so we’re gonna keep rolling.
*PAR: Okay.
*HV1: Are there other people in the home that help Child M with reading, and if so, what do they do to
help?
*PAR: Sometimes her and her little brother, he’s like a year, 11 months younger than her. They read
together sometimes and share books or whatever. Not too often, but then she’s more into what she
called chapter books or he’s in the second grade, so he hasn’t quite gotten to that. He’s an excellent
reader himself, but they read on two different levels.
*HV1: Sure. Okay.
*PAR: And her 15-year-old brother and I don’t think he’s too interested in it right now.
*HV1: Yeah.
*PAR: He reads a little bit, but not as much as Child M and I.
*HV1: So any other adults that help her with reading, ever, or –
*PAR: Well, aside from school, sometimes she’ll read to her grandparents. They take an interest. Her
father doesn’t live here. He lives in New Jersey, but sometimes when they’re talking on the phone, she
actually sits there and will read him a book.
*HV1: That’s very sweet. Okay, and number eight, how do you know if Child M has done a good job
reading a book?
*PAR: I’m not quite clear.
*HV1: Yeah, it’s a bit vague. What are indicators or signs that you look for that let you know that she’s
understood the book, that she’s been able to read it, that she’s done a good job?
*PAR: Well, I just simply ask her ____ _______, like I _____ ____ _____ understand what she read,
what was it about, and if I see she seems real hesitant, sometimes I assume she kind of just reads
through it. Sometimes I notice when we’re reading together and I look at her, those pages are flipping
too fast.
*HV1: Okay.
*PAR: So ____ ______ read it at ______, so even though she loves reading, sometimes I think kind of
through some of the boring stuff, she doesn’t really read it, and I don’t like for her to do that. I want her

to read the whole story even if that small part is boring, because it somewhere later on in the book it all
ties in together, so I don’t like her to ______.
*HV1: Yeah. Okay. Okay, and this is very much an opinion based question. What do you think makes
a good third grade reader? In other words, what should a good third grade reader be able to do at this
point?
*PAR: I think a good third grade reader should be able to, when they have ______ the story, be able to
tell you about any problems, what they’ve read, what they understood about what they read, give me a
brief summary of what they read. That’s really important, because like I say, I don’t like for her to rush
through the book and then she can’t tell me, or like when she’s doing her homework, she can’t answer
the questions because she hasn’t really took the time to really read and understand the story, so
sometimes she has to keep going back. Sometimes the answers are hidden in the stories. That’s what’s
important to me. I try to stress it a lot, is actually understanding what you read.
*HV1: Got it, and just two questions left. You’ve been so helpful. How would you describe Child M’s
reading skills?
*PAR: I think they’re pretty much above average for her age, but I do notice that the _______ said
_____ _____ challenge. I think it’s getting a little bit more difficult for her now, because the words are
getting longer.
*HV1: The books are getting thicker.
*PAR: Yeah, because I’m noticing things. I think that’s what it is, is the books are getting a little bit
more difficult for her.
*HV1: Okay.
*PAR: But I still think she’s a real good reader because she doesn’t give up.
*HV1: Okay.
*PAR: You know what I’m saying? Sometimes she gets tired with it. She doesn’t actually give up.
*HV1: Okay.
*PAR: She really wants to be a good reader.
*HV1: Got it. Okay, and last question, what goals do you have for Child M’s reading this summer?
*PAR: Well, when I found out about her being selected to participate, I was hoping her skills with
reading would improve for, like I said, the larger words and I want her to get a broader understanding
_____ more difficult and challenging rules.
*HV1: Right. Okay, well, those are all my questions for you, and typically it takes them a little bit
longer, so we’re just gonna use this time to do some logistical stuff if you’re okay with that, so remind
me. Eva told me you wanted which gift card? Didn’t we talk about this?
*PAR: No.
*HV1: Oh, okay. For your $50.00 gift card today, we have Wal-Mart, Food Lion, or BP Shell.

*PAR: Wal-Mart ___ ____.
*HV1: Okay, so I’m gonna get started on a receipt for that. Do you mind holding that?
*PAR: No, not at all.
*HV1: Thanks, so you have two other children?
*PAR: I do.
*HV1: Yeah.
*PAR: Well, I have three other children, but one is grown and out on his own.
*HV1: Oh, okay. You look so young. I can’t even imagine.
*PAR: Oh, thank you. Yeah, I have a 22-year-old.
*HV1: Oh, my goodness. Oh, and I meant to give this to you. This is just a flyer for the study that you
can hold onto.
*PAR: Okay.
*HV1: And remind me, what is today?
*PAR: The 5th.
*HV1: The 5th, right. I apologize that we were a little late in getting here.
*PAR: That’s okay. That is totally okay.
*HV1: We got a little bit lost.
*PAR: That is okay.
*HV1: I know you wanted to meet at 2:00 anyways, so I was like, “It’s just as well. They can spend
more time.”
*PAR: I just wanted to make sure I was here and calmed down. I had so much running to do for them.
*HV1: Totally. I hope we didn’t make you feel rushed.
*PAR: No, I didn’t. I didn’t at all. I just still wanted to make sure I was – you know how you have to get
it together.
*HV1: Oh, you need to transition from task to task.
*PAR: Exactly.
*HV1: I get that. Okay. This is the recorder that we’re gonna loan you for the summer.
*PAR: Okay.
*HV1: We’ve thrown some spare batteries in. We’re gonna show you how to use it. Someone will pick
it up from you at the end of the summer and this is where you’ll record your conversations, so I’m just

gonna make a note that I’m giving you H7. I’m just gonna ask you to print your name and sign right
there.
*PAR: Okay.
*HV1: Okay. Thank you so much.

*Other coded excerpts from home visit*
HV1: Okay, and what are some of your favorite things to do with Child M?
*PAR: I love to read, so I think a lot of it comes from her watching me ____ _____ around, because I love
to read. I love to read. I love to listen to music, and that’s basically what I like to do – love to do.
*


01-AVN
*HV1: So we're half done. I think the next part is more fun. This is just a series of open-ended
questions. So the first question I have for you: we're interested in knowing the kinds of things that you
and Child T do just in your everyday routine. So if you could just think about a typical day for Child T just
from the time she wakes up to the time she goes to bed on average what does that look like?

*PAR:
Getting ready for school, we get up at 7:30, she -- well up until October because
my son and his wife just moved back I was the one who was taking her to school but since they moved
back home, back to North Carolina I have a little granddaughter, they do to the same school with her, so
she's out of the house no later than 8:45, and she takes her and pick her up because they go to the same
school. And from there we here she come back home -- she get home like 3:45 and on a day 4:30, 5
o'clock, give her time to calm down or snack or something. We do homework. So about an hour and 30
minutes. And then from homework 'til she get her supper she take her bath, one or the other,
whichever one I can get her to do first. Take a bath, and then her reading times we do reading for 45
minutes. And after that bedtime.

*HV1: Okay, very thorough. Thank you. Next question: we're interested in learning more about Child
T's books and what interests her in terms of books. And I know she's showing (Home Visitor) some of
her books right now but my question for you is where does she get most of her books from?

*PAR:
The library. Either library downtown or ____ the school. And we have the book
program, Scholastics, that we buy. We can get the series of them. That's where we get the Jennie B.
Jones from.

*HV1: Got it. What are some things that you do to help Child T become a good reader?

*PAR:

Make her read.

*HV1: It starts right there, doesn't it?

*PAR:
And have her tell me what she read. If not we go back over it. And that comes
with her homework too because they have a lot of comprehension that they have to do like the reading
and stuff. She got to read it to get the answers.

*HV1: Okay, great. And what if anything do you do when you see she's having a hard time with a
book?

*PAR:
got to do it.

Make her stay there because sometimes she gets stubborn and she do it -- she

*HV1: So you tell her she's got to do it; do you do anything else when you see her struggling?

*PAR:
No. Mm-mm because I’m trying to get out that pattern. I don't want her to be
labeled. They pulling her during school time to read, and that has come up because like I tell her, "I'm
not going to limit you; you can do it." So she got to.

*HV1: Next thing: what are some questions you ask her when you talk to her about the books she's
read?

*PAR:
Does she understand it? Can she tell me what the story's talking about, the
name of the story, what chapter she's in. If she don't understand a word, what it means, she's going to
come and ask. And we're trying to get her to start using the dictionary now.

*HV1: Great. And you've already touched on this a little but this is the next question: what if anything
do you do to motivate her to read?

*PAR:
She just go at it 'cause she knows she got to do it. It's not really -- maybe once
out of the month she might get that, "I don't want to" but she knows she got to do it.

*HV1: So it's less using incentives and more being this is how it is, this is what you're going to do?

*PAR:
This is what I'm trying to do. And I have another grandson and she's so gung ho
after him, he's 13 now, and he's IB student _____.

*HV1: Oh, very impressive.

*PAR:
Yeah, he started at five and he left, he was in the IAD _________, from
Elementary to (School 2), now he'll be going to (School 3). And he's taking high school courses now at
(School 2). So --

*HV1: You must be so proud. You've worked so hard. I am impressed.

*PAR: But he'll be tenth grade and that's what she patterns after.

*HV1:

What an awesome role model.

*PAR: He was here with her until he turned eight. He used to stay with me. And still my daughter
comes and goes on weekends so we're still doing everything together. But she know where he's at in his
grading.

*HV1:

Sounds like he's a motivator for her.

*PAR:

Yes.

*HV1: That's a great example.

*PAR:

He'll be doing his college courses in tenth grade.

*HV1: You know, IB kids are just an impressive group. I've met some and the AIG kids and you're like,
"I wasn't this bright in middle school and high school." It's awesome.

*PAR:
Yes it is. So that's great for her. So she's on point, she got the help but that
disability just came from her mother, it's my niece, and she has it. But I got her the help in time and not
denying it, but not accepting it as a limitation.

*HV1: And that's what these kids need is someone who will actively intervene at the appropriate time.
Sounds like she's got that in you. And you've briefly talked about this already, but are there people in
the home that help Child T with reading and if so what are they doing to help?

*PAR:
My husband, like I say, I'm very busy into all kind of stuff, and if I'm not present
or able to stop and do what I need to do to help her with her reading or do she understand what she's
reading at the time. He's here now probably once a week or every two weeks, my son, he'll come up
and challenge her.

*HV1: And what does your husband do to help her when he's doing that?

*PAR:

The same thing.

*HV1: The same thing you're doing?

*PAR:
We don't do it for her; she have to do it for us. She have to tell us what she's
reading and just make sure she's on schedule.

*HV1: Got it. Okay. The next question: how do you know, what is an indicator for you, that Child T is
doing a good job?

*PAR:
Her level, just from where we started at, up until -- at one point she was calling
words and wasn't able to tell me what she was reading. I mean this -- she can understand it, she don't
call words, she knows what she's reading and she can recite.

*HV1: Great. And this is just an opinion-based question: what makes a good third-grade reader?
What should a good third-grade reader be able to do?

*PAR:
To read and not call words, read a full sentence, because this is the problem I
found in the system when I met this challenge that I'm doing with her: you read and when you're
reading you're reading, you pause at periods, commas and -- some children just call words.

*HV1: Tell me what you mean by calling words.

*PAR:
Like looking at that picture, "I love the man." I -- love -- you know, taking pauses
on the next word when you're at a level where you should be able to read that whole sentence and
stop.

*HV1: So essentially not taking pauses, not getting stumped.

*PAR:
Yeah, and to me that makes me understand that you know what you're reading
and you understand what you're reading. But if you calling words you're thinking about the next word,
to me -- am I right? Is this the right word I'm saying or is it wrong? But now she's able to recognize the
word to be able to read the full sentence. And she's at the level where she needs to be at. Because we
wasn't on that level.

*HV1: Sound like you've come a long way.

*PAR:
Yes. I mean because the school system you have some good teachers and you
have some bad teachers.

*HV1: Sure.

*PAR:
And that's what happened to me last year; we had a horrible teacher, and from
the first grade -- [crosstalk] -- for the parents. The first year she was horrible; we didn't find out until the
end of the school year when you looking, you getting these good grades but then you checking on time
you active in your child's life every day and you're saying, "Okay, this -- she should be higher than this."
And like math was a struggle for her last year because she didn't get math in the first grade. So now
we're getting pulled from that. Reading was a struggle for her in the first grade. Made it hard because
she would do it because she was young and I was able to help her. Third grade you don't need any help
because you should know. But I mean she has come a long way.

*HV1: Looks like she's made a lot of that ______ with a lot of help from people like you. And I just
want to keep us on time because I know you've got to get out of here and let me see --


01-ACD
**FROM OPEN-ENDED INTERVIEW
*HV1: Right. I understand. I totally understand that. All right. So this is the other set of questions.
We’re interested in knowing the kind of things you and your third grader do in your every day routines.
So tell me about a typical day for Child I from morning to bedtime as well as you can remember.

*PAR: Okay. From morning to bedtime. On Monday, just go to school early in the morning. Before
9:00. They get off 3:30, 3:20, 3:30. I don’t get back – well, actually Monday, that’s my early day release
for me. That’s the day that I can read with them. Okay. And I come home around 6:00. We read for
about 30 minutes. And then we eat dinner. After that, we review what’s, you know if there is anything
that I need to know like in school, you know. And we talk about everything right there. That’s Mondays
and Tuesdays my early release days.

*HV1: And so we’re interested in learning more about your child’s books and reading interests. So
right now Child I’s in there showing (Home Visitor) some books. Where did you get most of her books
from? So would it be the school library, public library? Did you buy them for her or did someone else
give them to her? Or did the school give them to her?

*PAR: The school.

*HV1: The school.

*PAR: Yeah. Most of them the school.

*HV1: Okay. And what are some things that you do to help –

[Ringing Phone]

*PAR: I’m sorry. Okay.

*HV1: What are some things that you do to help your child become a good reader?

*PAR: I ask her – well, she reads and she just had to practice more and more. And that’s what help her
out a lot lately. Like I said, in the last three months she has improved a lot in reading.

*HV1: Mm hmm. Okay. And what, if anything, do you do when your child has a hard time reading a
book?

*PAR: What’s the question again?

*HV1: Oh. What, if anything, do you do when your child has a hard time with a book?

*PAR: Slow down. You know do it again. Slowly until you get it right.

*HV1: Okay. And what are some questions that you ask your child when you talk about books that she
has read?

*PAR: Why do you like the story? Mainly I notice that she likes the story because of something that
happened to a boy and a dog or something. It started like that. You know they like that kind of story.
They concentrating more on ____.

*HV1: And what, if anything, do you do to motivate your child to read?

*PAR: Anything that I do to motivate her. She enjoys reading with me or doing any type of homework
with me. I mean I notice that it's a little bit different with her grandma when she does it. But I notice
that she wants me to be there with her.

*HV1: Okay.

*PAR: So that motivates her. I believe that motivates her to do more.

**OTHER CODED EXCERPTS FROM HOME VISIT
*PAR: Okay. Yes. Child I has from the beginning, from kindergarten, had a little bit of a problem, you
know as far as catching up because she started out late in kindergarten. So the main problem for that

was because they don’t have a mother. So that really affected her, you know. So sometimes when she
can concentrate, I notice that she loves for me to be with her, you know as far as reading or asking her
questions. Most of all, you know I ask her to read for me like once a week or twice. You know cause I
have to work late. But what I like for her most to do is do math. You know multiplication, you know
adding. Stuff like that. And ask the words, you know complete sentences. Stuff like that. So right now I
think she can read much better than three months ago. She has improved a lot in three months.
***
*HV1: Zero to three. Okay. How often do you read with Child I?
*PAR: Every chance I get. Like I said, I have to work late, so my mom, my mother does a lot of reading
with her when I’m at work. And so I’m thinking she reads at least three times a week too. At least.
***
*HV1: So never, hardly ever. How often do you buy Child I books?

*PAR: A book? Well, the books that we’ve been getting from school. So.

*HV1: So would you say never or hardly ever or once or twice a year?

*PAR: Once a month. Because once she likes a book and I look at it and I see it’s something that she can
learn, I’ll buy it for her.


01-AJE
*Excerpts from overall home visit*
HV1: Okay. Um, and how often does she read her books? Almost never, once or twice a month¾
PAR2: She has read them all, when she has read them she doesn’t like to read the same thing. I know
that she often brings books borrowed from school.
HV1: Ah, she can get them at school, [0:03:00]she brings them, and then she keeps changing them. And

01-AIA
*open-ended interview*

*HV1: All right. And the next set of questions: we're interested in knowing the kind of things you and
Child N do in your everyday routine. So tell me about a typical day for Child N from morning to bedtime
as well as you can remember.

*PAR:
She get up at 6 o'clock in the morning, she wash her face, brush her teeth, she
get ready for school. If she have time she'll make her bed. She go to school, she come home, she start
on her homework, get her snack, we may go somewhere we may not. If we don't go nowhere after her
homework is done she'll watch TV or help me clean up.

*HV1: We're interested in learning more about your child's books and reading interests. Child N is
showing (Home Visitor) some books right now. Where did you get most of her books from, school
library, public library? Did you buy them?

*PAR:

Buy.

*HV1: Okay. What are some things you do to help Child N become a good reader?

*PAR:
If she read a story I might not ask her right then about the story; sometimes I'll
wait and then ask her.

*HV1: So just asking her a question about the book. Okay. What, if anything, do you do when your
child has a hard time with a book?

*PAR:
If it's too hard, because she have picked up some books for school that was
above her grade level I tell her take it back and get another one. If it's some words that she don't
understand we'll try to sound it out or if it's too hard for her to sound it out I'll tell her.

*HV1: What are some questions that you ask your child when you talk about books that she has read?

*PAR:
What happened in the story and if she tell me -- get her to tell me the people
that's in the book and she tell me different parts of each person in the book.

*HV1: What if anything do you do to motivate your child to read?

*PAR:

If she see me read she'll go get a book.

*HV1: Are there other people in your home that help your child with the reading?

*PAR:

Yes, I have a 21-year-old daughter -- she helps.

*HV1: How do you know if your child's done a good job reading a book?

*PAR:
If she reading a book and if she can't get a sentence right I tell her to start over.
But sometimes I have no problem she'll read it with no problems.

*HV1: What makes a good third grade reader?

*PAR:

Just keep practicing reading.

*HV1: Okay and what should a good reader be able to do?

*PAR:
After she read a book be able to tell you about the book without having to look
back through the book.

*HV1: How would you describe your child's reading skills?

*PAR:

It's not where it should be but it's getting better.

*HV1: What kind of things like as far as her skills do you think that she should _____ -- when you say
it's not where it should be.

*PAR:
She get frustrated and might just stop. That's why I try to read with her. Or she
like say it might say how often, and instead of her saying often she'll come up with a word instead of
that word and just try to keep on reading.

*HV1: What goals do you have for your child's reading this summer?

*PAR:
summer camp too.

This program she going to summer camp. I think they have reading in the

*HV1: Very good. Sounds good. I think they should be finishing up in there and once they finish up
they'll come in and we'll do the last part.

*other excerpts from home visit*
*HV1: How often do you talk with Child N about reading?
*PAR: Every night 'cause she had to read 30 minutes every night, and after the reads she have to write it
on her paper so I ask her what was the story about so she can write it on her paper.


01-AMX

*open-ended interview*
*HV1: Thank you. Okay, great. So for the last two-thirds, I’m just going to ask some open-ended
questions, and the first, we are interested in knowing the kinds of things that you and Child D do in your
everyday routine. So if you were to think about what a typical day looks like for Child D from when he
gets up to when he goes to bed, can you walk me through that?

*PAR: Okay. He gets up 7:00. He has his breakfast. I take girls to school; I come back. He gets – he
does his ADLs, gets ready for school. We leave home at 8:00. I take him to school. I get home 5:00,
5:30. He’s usually already had his dinner, so sometimes we sit and watch TV or I’ll ask him about his day
at school, whether he has homework. If he has homework that’s needing done, we do homework. And
then he comes out and play.

*HV1: Okay. So do homework, come out and play. Then what?

*PAR: He’ll play – the little guy that just stopped by, that’s one of his friends. They’ll get together.
They play. He goes home maybe about 8:00. We just sit out on the porch sometimes.

We just talk. Go in the house. He gets his bath. He’ll watch TV. Sometimes, we watch
basketball games or football games or he’ll play his little video game. And around 9:30 I like for him to
be in bed.

*HV1: Great, thank you. All right, we’re interested in learning about Child D’s books and his reading
interests, and I can hear him showing Miss (Home Visitor) his books right now. But our question for you
is where did you get most of his books from?

*PAR: Book fair. There was one of the church members whose sister was a retired school teacher. She
gave them books. I buy books at work. If they have book sales at work, I’ll buy books. So I guess we just
accumulate books, and then I’ve always had books.

If I see something I think they may like, I just buy it, whether it’d be believe it or not or strange
facts or something. I try to get a variety of books.

*HV1: Okay, great. And what are some things that you do to help Child D become a good reader?

*PAR: Number one, I try to get him to slow down in his reading. I was like that; I could read well, but
sometimes you just read so fast, you will skip words or put words that are not there or omit words. So I
try to get him to slow down and just read. And then I ask him if he understands what he read or if he
has trouble – very seldom does he have trouble pronouncing words, but do you know what that means.

And with the little test they have, you have to go back and what did this word mean in this
paragraph, so we’ll look at it, and usually, he can tell you what it means.

*HV1: Okay, okay. Great. And what, if anything, do you do when you see that he is having a hard time
with a book?

*PAR: I just tell him to slow down. Instead of trying to read a whole book, let’s say we read five pages.
Or…

*HV1: Making it more manageable.

*PAR: Yes, yes. You know, let’s not try to read a whole book. One of his teachers I think in his second
grade said he’s ready now for chapter books, so we would get chapter books, but we would maybe do
one chapter. If it’s five pages, eight pages, okay, we’re done.

*HV1: Okay.

*PAR: What was that chapter about, and we go from there.

*HV1: Okay. You know, you just mentioned this. What are some questions that you ask Child D when
you talk to him about books that he’s read?

*PAR: What was the story about? You know, what was the…

[Side conversation]

What was said about, you know, just some of the basic stuff. Who, what ____. [Laughter]

*HV1:

Got it. And what, if anything, do you do to motivate Child D to read?

*PAR: I try to instill in all the kids that reading is fundamental. You have to know how to read to do
anything. If you cook, you have to know how to read. If you drive, you have to know how to read. You
want to act, you have to be able to read the script. If you play sports, you gotta read plays, so you have
to know how to read and understand what you read.

*HV1: That’s a really nice way of presenting it. Yeah, very practical.

*PAR: Yeah. [Laughter]

*HV1: Are there other people in the home that help Child D with reading?

*PAR: His mother likes to read.

*HV1: Does she live in the home?

*PAR: Mm-hmm.

*HV1: Okay.

*PAR: His older sister is a reader. And I think that helped him because being the youngest, he did –
they would sit him down and they would read – she would read to him. He would see her read, so he
would try to pick up the book and read. And I think we – I taught him basically how to read the way my
mother taught me; you look at the pictures. You look at the story.

You know, you try to associate the lines with what they’re doing in the picture. And I’m oldschool. I grew up with Dick and Jane books, and I found Dick and Jane books, I mean the big volumes,

and I bought Dick and Jane books. And then she was repetitive; see Dick run; run, Dick, run. But he
learned how to read with the Dick and Jane books. [Laughter]

*HV1: That’s – I love that you drew on your childhood. [Laughter] So you had mentioned that his
mom lives in the home and will occasionally help him with his reading.

*PAR: Yeah, oh yeah.

*HV1: What does she do to help him with his reading that you’ve noticed?

*PAR: I mean she encourages him. She, as I said, she likes to read. My mother – you read. I don’t care
who you were, you read. So we all got that and she’ll just sit down with him sometimes. He’ll want to
do his homework with her. Sometimes I’m too hard, you know, but yeah.

*HV1: Okay. And you had also mentioned his older sister, and it sounded more like she leads by
example and by actually sitting down and working with him. Did I pick on that right? Or does she
actually stand and read with him?

*PAR: She would read with him.

*HV1: Okay.

*PAR: Oh yeah, yeah.

*HV1: And what will she – does she have anything specific that she does?

*PAR: No, she’s one of the – she’s real independent. She used to read the dictionary, so I’d look up
and he would be reading the dictionary. She was the only child for a while, and my mother read the
Bible faithfully, so she was sitting reading the Bible and writing down stuff. So she’s real independent
and she’ll just start reading, so.

*HV1: Great, okay. And how do you know if Child D has done a good job of reading a book?

*PAR: He will be able to write down what has happened or I can ask him because usually what I do if
he has something to read, I read it first, then I say okay, you read it. And then if there are questions that
follow, he can – if he can answers the questions without turning back and looking at the paragraph, I
know he has read it and understood it.

*HV1: Got it. Okay. It’s a good indicator. What, in your opinion, makes a good third grade reader? So
in other words, what should a good third grade reader be able to do?

*PAR: They should be able – the biggest thing is to be able to read. People say they can read what
they call words, and there’s a difference between calling ‘em words and actually reading. You read; you
understand what you read. And if you can comprehend what you read and tell me back in your own
words what you read, I think you’re doing a good job.

[Side conversation]

So I think you’ve done a good job if you can do that. And a lot of kids really don’t like to read.
Why do I need to read? Everything is on the computer, online, on DVD, whatever. But there’s nothing
like picking up a book and turning pages.

*HV1: Mm-hmm, I agree.

*PAR: And it enhances your vocabulary, your spelling, so.

*HV1: All right, great. Thank you. How would you describe Child D’s reading skills?

*PAR: Excellent. I was really surprised at his reading level and how well he could read, and not just call
words, but flow. You know, some people – see, dah, dah, de. It’s like singing a song. But just to be able
to read and know the words and not just muffle ‘em up, so I think he’s an excellent reader.

*HV1: And last question for you. What goals do you have for Child D’s reading this summer?

*PAR: I would like for him to continue to improve in his reading. He’ll be going to the fourth grade.
The reading level changes. Words are different. You have to be able to understand what you read.
Each grade, you get more, so it’s like a pyramid. Kindergarten and each grade you build up. So each
level is important, so you have to be able to compile all this knowledge and read and understand and be
able to write a paragraph or a decent sentence.

*HV1: So okay, so that helps me see what your goals are for him. Okay. Great. Well, thank you for
providing us with all that helpful information. And I will tell you the child portion usually takes a little bit
longer, so we can just jump to some logistics. Let me just check with them and see where they are at.
*Other excerpts from home visit*
*HV1: And what are some of your favorite things to do with him?
*PAR: Well, with him, I am not quite as active as I used to be. I’m a little bit older. [Laughter] But we do
watch TV together. If he gets a book or he wants to sit down and tell me about his books, we do that.
And we just talk, just nothing special. We just do things.
*HV1: And you were saying that one of those things is just talking with him about his books.
*PAR: Yes, yes.


01-ATX
*HV1: We are interested in knowing what you and your third-grade child do in your daily routines.
[0:16:59] Please tell me about a typical day for Child A from the moment he wakes up until he goes to
bed.
*PAR1 F: Um… Can you repeat the question?
*HV1: Yes. We are interested in knowing what you and your third-grade child do in your daily routines.
*PAR1 F: Uh-huh.
*HV1: Okay. Tell me about a typical day for Child A from the moment he wakes up until he goes to bed.
[0:17:31]
(long silence)
*PAR1 F: Like sometimes he doesn’t want to get up to go to school. [0:17:58] I always have to get up to,
to wake him up. And I give him his clothes for him to change his clothes and I take him. Every day I take
him to school.
*HV1: And then?
*PAR1 F: Um…
*HV1: From the time he wakes up until he goes to bed?
[0:18:30]
*PAR1 F: And, um… I tell him to brush his teeth and change… But in the evening (inaudible)
*HV1: A little bit louder so we can hear your voice.
[0:19:00]
*PAR1 F: When… He is always with him, because I work.
*HV1: Okay.
*PAR1 F: Sometimes, um… when I’m here, he goes to bed later, at 10:00 or 11:00 pm.
*HV1: Very good. We are interested in knowing about the books that interest him.[0:19:27] Child A
showed (Home Visitor) … excuse me, (Home Visitor), some books. Where did Child A get most of his
books?
*PAR1 F: From school? What? From school.
*HV1: From the school he attends. Any other place?
*PAR1 F: There.
*HV1: From the library, is that what you are saying?
[0:19:59]

*PAR1 F: Um…
*HV1: From the school library.
*PAR2 M: Yes.
*HV1: What are some of the things you do to make Child A a good reader?
[0:20:13]
*PAR2 M: Well, so he passes his grade, he has to be at the reading level of his grade. That is why I think
it is necessary for him to learn.
*HV1: But you, Mrs. Parent A, what are some of the things that you, you do to make him a good reader?
[0:20:35]
*PAR1 F: I send him to school and, and, and…
*HV1: For example, what do you do for him to learn the meaning of new words? Do you do something
specific?
[0:20:57]
*PAR1 F: I am teaching him how to speak, how, how to say some words he doesn’t know. Because he
doesn’t speak Spanish.
*HV1: He doesn’t speak Spanish.
*PAR1 F: No.
*HV1: How do you communicate with him?
*PAR1 F: He speaks it, but not very well.
*HV1: Okay.
*PAR1 F: He says the words the other way around.
*HV1: Okay.
[0:21:30]
*PAR1 F: Uh-huh.
*HV1: What do you do, if anything, to help him understand what he reads? Could you tell us?
*PAR1 F: Um…
*PAR2 M: We tell him how to say something if he doesn’t know how to say it. She can’t explain what she
wants to say, that is why I’m telling you.
*PAR1 F: (laughter)
*HV1: No, I’m here waiting, I’m in no hurry.

[0:21:57]
*PAR2 M: We are like, like teaching him how to say what he doesn’t know how to say it. And we are
helping him on how to say it.
*HV1: And you, Mrs. Parent A, do you do something specific? To help him understand what he reads?
*PAR1 F: Yes, I ask him to repeat what the book says or anything he does.
[0:22:34]
*HV1: Do you do something specific so your child has time to read?
*PAR1 F: Yes… He always, um… Sometimes I turn the TV off when he is watching TV, because I want for
him to do his homework, or, or he reads first and watches TV or plays afterwards.
[0:22:07]
*HV1: Do you do something specific to motivate him to read?
*PAR2 M: (to PAR1) If you do something to help him.
*HV1: To motivate him, to motivate him, to make him want to read.
[0:22:32]
*PAR1 F: Um…
*HV1: If you do something, you don’t really need to have an answer.
*HV1: So we now who is discussing the reading with her.
*PAR1 F: Well, yes, sometimes he doesn’t want to read, but I tell him he has to read to pass his grade, so
he won’t stay behind.
*PAR2 M: (to PAR1) Can you explain it a little bit? Like when you tell him, do this and I will buy you this.
*PAR1 F: (laughter)
*PAR2 M: Do this and I will take you there. [0:24:00] Do this and I will give you this. To motivate him.
*PAR1 F: And when… I tell him that if he does what I say, I tell him I will celebrate his birthday. Because
he knows what month is his birthday, and he loves to celebrate his birthday.
(long silence)
*HV1: What are some of the questions you ask Child A about the books he reads? That he has read?
[0:25:02]
*PAR2 M: He, he doesn’t ask questions. He tells us about what he is reading.
*PAR1 F: He tells us. He tells us what the book says.
*HV1: But… do you ask him questions?

*PAR1 F: No.
*HV1: No. You don’t ask him questions.
*PAR1 F: No.
*HV1: Okay.
*PAR2 M: He tells us the story
*HV1: Okay. There are some other people that Ah-hah, go ahead
[0:25:30]
*PAR2 M: He tells us the story he is reading about, and what I tell him is, “Okay, that’s nice. Keep
reading so you know more about the story and what else happens”. And then he reads more, he keeps
reading.
*HV1: Mm.
*PAR2 M: But we don’t ask questions when it’s not relevant.
*HV1: Sure. Is there anyone else at home that can help Child A to read?
[0:26:01]
*PAR1 F: Um, his sister.
*HV1: His sister.
*PAR1 F: Uh-huh.
*HV1: What does his sister do to help him?
*PAR2 M: She teaches him.
*PAR1 F: She teaches him how to do… When he doesn’t know how to do his homework, she helps him.
She helps him do his homework and, and to read.
*HV1: Does she do something specific that you know of? [0:26:30] Just with reading, not homework.
*PAR2 M: She teaches him the word he doesn’t know how to pronounce, or how to pronounce them,
because he still finds words he still doesn’t know how they are pronounced.
*HV1: Sure.
*PAR2 M: She teaches him.
*HV1: So then you are one of the persons, the other person would be you, right?
*PAR2 M: Uh-huh.
*HV1: Because the question is, “Are there other people in the house that can help him to
read”?[0:27:01] Because the question is for you, who would be the other person? (to PAR1) You too?
What do you do to help him?

*PAR2 M: The same, the same. I’m doing what I just told you. Because when I know the word, I tell him
how to pronounce it, but when I don’t know, I say, let’s ask Child M to know how to pronounce it.
[0:27:31] Sometimes he doesn’t believe me when I tell him how to pronounce that word, and I tell him,
“Ask Child M and you’ll see I’m right”. Sometimes he doesn’t believe that, he doesn’t believe me, like
when I tell him how that word is pronounced. And then I tell him, “Ask Child M and you will see I’m
right”. And then he asks Child M.
(long silence)

*other excerpts from home visit*
*PAR2 M: He reads almost every afternoon. Although a little bit or something short, but he reads,
because we know they have told him he has to read about 20 minutes daily, although he doesn’t do 20,
but he reads little by little. And about two or three times he does quatrains or verses.
*
*PAR2 M: We don’t buy him books, he brings them from school because we don’t want, well,
sometimes we don’t have… we have limited money, we don’t buy because of the money. He asks for
them when we go shopping, but we only have for what we went to buy, and we don’t have (money) for
books. [0:12:56] Sometimes books are $10 to $20, and we don’t have that money, we have sometimes
$3 to $5. But he doesn’t want the book we offer him, he wants the $10 or the $15 book.


01-BBU
[0:01:35] I thank you again for your time with us, because you really have to take time from your busy
routine. Um, I will start asking you the questions. We are interested in knowing the activities you do
with your third-grade child in your daily routines.
[0:02:05] Please tell me about a typical day for Child N from the moment he wakes up until he goes to
bed, as much as you can remember.
PAR1: Well, he wakes up and gets ready for school.
[0:02:30] Then he brushes his teeth. And has breakfast. And then he comes back from school. And he
comes to watch TV. And when he remembers, he starts doing homework. And after he does homework,
he watches TV for a while. And then he goes to sleep till the next day for school [sic].
[0:03:05]
HV1: Okay. Very good. We are also interested in the books that Child N [ph] is interested in reading. Ah,
Child N is showing (home visitor) some books at this moment, as you can see. Where did your son get
most of his books?
[0:03:34]
PAR1: Um, some we have purchased and others he gets when we go to church to pick up clothes.
HV1: They are donated.
PAR1: Yes, they are donated.
HV1: From church.
PAR1: Ah-hah.
[0:04:00]
HV1: From where else?
PAR1: We buy them.
HV1: Where do you go to buy them?
PAR1: Um, well… in a… in Wallmart.
[0:04:29]
HV1 Okay. Yes. Very good. What are some of the things you do to help Child N become a good reader?
PAR1: Well, (indiscernible). He doesn’t understand Spanish, the alphabet… um, the vowels…
[0:04:58]
HV1: What do you do, for example, to make sure he has time to read during the day?
PAR1: Well, I don’t do very much (laughter).

HV1: Uh-huh. Okay.
PAR1: During the day I don’t pay much attention to his reading. He doesn’t like it very much. I have to
keep telling him.
HV1: Okay.
PAR1: I mean, he doesn’t grab his books to study, no.
[0:05:33]
HV1: What do you tell him?
PAR1: I tell him to pick up the book and study. No, he doesn’t want to.
HV1: Okay. And, and can you tell me… a little while ago you were explaining to me about the alphabet,
right?
PAR1: Uh-huh.
HV1: Do you do something for him to learn the meaning of new words?
PAR1: Yes, I
HV1: New words. In Spanish, you told me.
PAR1: Yes, in Spanish, because I don’t speak English.
HV1: Okay.
PAR1: Yes, I taught him in Spanish, but he already knows all of them. And the vowels too.
[0:06:06]
HV1: The words. And do you do anything special to improve his understanding of reading, of what he
reads? Not only the words, but everything he.. if it is a story, that he understands the story, that he
PAR1: Yes, when he studies the book and I ask him afterwards if he understands what it means.
HV1: You ask him?
PAR1: Yes, if he knows what it means, and he does.
[0:06:30]
HV1: Okay, you ask him and he knows.
PAR1: Uh-huh.
(rustling papers)
HV1: What do you do if he has difficulties reading a book, a story, or anything?
PAR1: Well, the only thing I tell him is to mark it, because I don’t know.
HV1: To mark the book.

PAR1: Yes, to mark where he doesn’t understand that word, and
[0:07:01]
HV1: And do you look it up, or not?
PAR1: No, because I can’t help him, I don’t know English.
HV1: Oh, because the reading is in English.
PAR1: Yes, and what I tell him is to mark it and ask the teacher.
HV1: The teacher.
PAR1: Yes.
HV1: You were telling me you ask him questions. What kinds of questions more or less do you ask him
when, when, after he reads something?
[0:07:32]
PAR1: Um, like questions about the book, about what he is studying. Because he tells me what he
studied, and I ask him, “What did it mean, the page you studied.” And he knows the parts he has
studied, but I
HV1: And what do you ask him?
PAR1: Huh?
HV1: What do you ask him?
PAR1: Um… (long silence)
[0:08:02]
HV1: If you don’t ask him anything, that’s okay, you don’t ask him.
PAR1: No, (laughter) I don’t know, I just ask him about the page he studied, and he answers me.
HV1: And do you do any specific thing to motivate him, you know, to motivate, to make him want to
read more?
PAR1: Ah, yes.
HV1: Do you do something, I don’t know, do you do something specific?
PAR1: Yes.
[0:08:31]
HV1: Like what?
(long silence)
[0:09:00]

PAR1: You mean like
HV1: To motivate, make him want it more.
PAR1: Well, I change the word, but the only thing is that I start a conversation with him in Spanish,
because I can’t converse in English, and um, like he wants to learn more Spanish, when he says any
word, what it means.
[0:09:34]
HV1: Okay. Is there any other person who helps him
PAR1: With homework?
HV1: At home, that can help him read?
PAR1: Only if I understand it a little bit. I don’t know if
HV1: Are there other people who help him?
PAR1: No.
HV1: Here at home?
PAR1: Uh-uh.
HV1: No.
PAR1: Uh-uh.
[0:09:58]
HV1: How do you know if he, he underst , if he does a good job when he reads a book?
PAR1: Uh… That I know how?
[0:09:58]
HV1: If… How do you know if he understood the book?
PAR1: How do I know if he understood the book?
HV1: If he did a good job, if he… Exactly.
PAR1: Um…
HV1: How do you know if you… if your son did a good job when he read the book?
PAR1: Well, I really don’t know, because…
[0: 11:05]
HV1: Okay. Well… no…
PAR1: I don’t understand the question very well.


01-AUB
*open-ended interview*

*HV1: Right. Okay. So we’re interested in knowing the kind of things you and your third grader do in
your everyday routine. So tell me about a typical day for Child J, from morning to bedtime, as well as
you can remember.

*PAR: Okay. So Child J is like the captain of the ship, so he kind of starts everything off. I’ll wake him
up and he gets himself ready and together. Then once he does that I’m normally cooking breakfast or
something and he’ll help get his brother ready for school. Then we get to school. I don’t know about
that. Then we get home and he comes, he asks his brother and sister if they want anything to eat. He’ll
fix them a little snack and he’ll fix him one and then they’ll eat the snack and then he’ll go get started on
his homework. He’ll finish that then he’ll go outside and play for a while.

[Inaudible speaking in the background]

Then after he plays outside they’ll come in for dinner and wash up, come eat dinner. He’ll go in
the shower and after that he’ll read for about 20 minutes or so. He tries to cheat me sometimes and
say, “Oh, Mom, I’m finished.” I’m like, “We just started reading. That’s not ten minutes,” but then he
goes to bed. That’s about it.

*HV1: So we’re interested in learning more about your child’s books and reading interests. So Child J is
showing (Home visitor) some books right now. Where did you get most of his books from?

*PAR: A lot of them I got when the library has the Friends of the Library Sales. I got a lot of those there
and from the book fairs at his school.

*HV1: So you would say you bought them because the choices are school library, public library. Did
you buy them? Did someone else give them to him or did the school give them to him?

*PAR: Most of them I bought. He’s been given quite a few, too, but most of them I bought.

*HV1: Okay. What are some things that you do to help your child become a good reader?

*PAR: I’ll talk with Child J, trying to get him to put things in his words that he read. “Don’t try and
recite the book.” I’ll ask him, “What happened?” and he’ll try and look in the book and try and tell me.
I’m like, “No. Close the book and then tell me what happened.” That’s my main thing. “I want you to
be able to retell it to me in your words.”

*HV1: Okay, and what, if anything, do you do when your child has a hard time with a book?

*PAR: I look at it first to see if it’s okay, if it’s just too far-fetched in the words. Other than that, I have
him show me, “How would you break that word down?” But really, Child J’s breaking down words is
really good. He can break down a word, but as far as him getting the meaning, uh uh. But my uncle will
have Child J look something up in the dictionary in a heartbeat.

*HV1: Okay. What are some questions that you ask your child when you talk about books that he has
read?

*PAR: I ask him, “Who was the book about? Who were the characters in the book? Where did it take
place?” What else? I do ask him, “How could you relate that to yourself?” That’s the one that a lot of
kids ______ _____ have a problem with relating it to themselves.

*HV1: Connection?

*PAR: Yeah. “Did he enjoy the book?” That’s about it.

*HV1: Okay. What, if anything, do you do to motivate Child J to read?

*PAR: I tell him about my past, hoping that he’ll finally get it. I tell him, “These movies that you may
watch, if you read the book first it’ll be even better.” I tell him the story about the movie, “_____
______.” I wasn’t allowed to watch the movie until I read the book and I appreciated it because I knew
what was going to happen in the movie.

*HV1: Right. So are there other people in your home that help Child J with reading?

*PAR: Yes. My uncle helps Child J a lot. Pretty much just my uncle and my boyfriend.

*HV1: Okay, lives here?

*PAR: Yeah, he does live here.

*HV1: Okay, and how do you know if your child has done a good job reading a book?

*PAR: He can tell me about it. He can tell me about it in his own words from front to back and I’ll hear
the excitement in his voice. If he’s just, “Well, Timmy dropped the ball and blah blah,” and tells me
insignificant little details, he didn’t.

*HV1: Okay. What makes a good third-grade reader?

*PAR: I think a good third-grade reader is someone that can read it and retell it and understand the
reason the author wrote the book, whether they wrote it to just give you a little laugh or they were
trying to teach you something.

[Inaudible speaking in the background]

*HV1: What should a good reader be able to do?

*PAR: They should be able to, first of all, read through and understand the words that they’re reading.

[Inaudible speaking in the background]

And to be able to retell it.

*HV1: Okay.

*other excerpts from home visit*
*HV1: Okay. How often does Child J read for fun on his own time?
*PAR: Hardly ever. I have to tell him. I even told him one day. I was like, “Child J, sometimes when I’m
in the bathroom, y’all think I’m really using the bathroom. No. I’m getting away from y’all to read my
book. So I take a book with me in the bathroom. If you know you’re going to be in there for a while,
take a book,” and he did it. Actually, he did it one day this week and he was like, “Mom, that was good.”
[Laughter]
So hopefully, that’ll change.

*open-ended interview*
HV05: We are interested to learn the daily activities of both you and your child. Tell me please about a
typical day of Child A since he wakes up to bedtime, as much as you can remember.

[00:09:39.06]

PAR: Well let me remember, when he wakes up he wants to take breakfast.

HV05: ok

PAR: Umm, he plays with her little brothers, umm... then I put them to read or to study, the call it "to
study". They study for a while, they if the have homework and they do it to deliver it in Monday in
school... they take dinner, they go out to play outside, they come inside and then they watch some TV.

[00:10:19.09]

HV05: I am sorry?

PAR: The watch some TV.

HV05: Ok.

PAR: And they play with their little brothers or if they have something to make up, they do.

[00:10:32.16]

HV05: Make up what?

PAR: Oh to make up and clean their clothes, shoes...

HV05: Ok, and then? That is the end of the day, right?
Laughs

PAR: Yes, because they go to bed early.

HV05: Ok.

PAR: If they afternoon are good, they go out and play for a while.

HV05: We are interested to learn more about the books that your child reads and his reading interests.
Child A is showing (home visitor)some books right now. Where acquired Child A most of his books?

[00:11:09.21]

PAR: In the school.

HV05: Can you tell me more? Lent book?

PAR: Yes, lent. He then returns it. He lends them from the school and then he returns them.

HV05: The books are from the library?

PAR: Yes, they are from the school.

HV05: From the school, right.

[00:11:28.29]

HV05: Very well, what are of some of the things you do to help Child A to become a better reader?

PAR: Listen what he is reading.

HV05: How?

PAR: He reads to me and I tell him if he is reading well.

HV05: Ok.

PAR: But he reads for me in Spanish, not in English. He reads in English for her little sister.

HV05: Ok.

PAR: And I tell if he is doing well in his reading.

[00:12:00.17]

HV05: How old is his little sister?

PAR: Ten.

HV05: Ok, do you do something in particular so that he can learn, for example, the meaning of a word?

PAR: Oh, if he asks me the way that a word must be written I spell it for him so that he can write, for
example, how does "grandmother" spell? And then I tell him the letters of that word in Spanish, because
he is also learning Spanish. I spell each letter for him and then he writes them. He is very smart to fit the
words, more than in Spanish.

[00:12:44.14]

HV05: You told me that you tell him to read, what do you specifically do to encourage him?

[00:13:01.01]

PAR: I tell him to read because it is good for him, so that he can triumph in life, unlike me. Because the
way I ... I prefer him to be someone il life.one in life. I talk a lot about this to them, when I am driving I
talk to them about things in life, how we were when we had his age, what we used to do and what they
don´t. That is the way I encourage them, I tell them "Do you guys want to be like me and your dad? Do
you want to endure what we suffer?" and they answer me "No mommy, we don´t want that” and then I
say "Then study".

[00:13:44.01]

HV05: Is there another person in the house that can help him to read?

PAR: Yes, he reads a lot with his friend. Because I work sometimes and he... um...this boy is here with
us... then he reads with them.

[00:14:01.04]

HV05: Which friend is him?

PAR: Umm, he is a ....how can I explain this? I don´t now if you are going to understand...laughs, he is a
boy... umm, how can explain umm...

HV05: It can be like...

PAR: He always has been together with us.

HV05: He can be like a father or...

PAR: No.

HV05: like an older brother.

PAR: No, he is from another place but us gets along very well with us.

[00:14:30.16]

HV05: Ok, he is a family friend.

PAR: Yes, we know him from a long time.

HV05: Yes, right. And what he does to help Child A?

PAR: He reads with Child A.

HV05: How old is this family friend?

PAR: Umm, he is older than me! Laughs, he was a teacher in the place from he comes from so helps
him. Child A was doing pretty badly in the school and he helped him.

HV05: He helped Child A?

PAR: Yes, he helped him.

HV05: What did he do?

[00:14:58.25]

PAR: Well, when Child A came from school my friend uses to tell him " Child A, TV is no good, go study"
he turned off the TV and then he read with, or he helps doing his homework.

HV05: Uh-huh, but regarding reading, do you know if something does in particular, an activity or
something?

PAR: Yes, he puts him to read, for example. He asks him for an example of something in the book, a part
or a section of the story. He helps him a lot he was doing bad in school.

[00:15:43.23]

HV05: How would you describe the reading skills of Child A?

PAR: Hmm, well. He is very good; he does not read a lot with me because I work but when I listen to
him reading I know that he reads well.

[00:16:04.04]

HV05: What objectives do you have for the reading of Child A for summer?

PAR: He must read more so that he can learn. He must reads Spanish too so that he understand both
languages. He should read a lot of Spanish, and also English.

HV05: Very good.

[00:16:28.19]

PAR: I tell him each day "you are going to read this and this book" because they send me books by mail.

HV05: Who?

PAR: They send me an application from the school asking me if I want books for summer and they send
me books for my children.

HV05: You are talking about this program or...?

PAR: I do not know.

HV05: You do not know... I think it is this program.

PAR: I think yes.

HV05: When took place that?

PAR: When it was? The last year in summer.

HV05: Oh last year.

[00:16:57.25]

PAR: Oh no, I am mistaken. We were not here last year, we made the mistake to go to Honduras and
come back... it was before last year.

HV05: Before last year.

PAR: Aha, yes they sent him a lot of books. And also my daughter reads with him. She motivates him a
lot because she reads a lot daily, in the morning and in the afternoon. So I tell him to learn from her so
that he can learn more.

[00:17:28.08]

HV05: Very good.
Silence

HV05: Ok, I have here other questions. How do you know if Child A has done a good job reading a book
or after reading a book?

[00:17:54.11]

PAR: Because I tell him to explain what the book was about... and, I do not know, and I do not know if
he lies to me because the book is in English and he speaks me in Spanish. So he explains me about the
book and the story, for example the story of a child who did not obey his father and bad things
happened to him, he explains the story to me.

[00:18:29.17]

HV05: Very well, what is capable of a 3rd degree reader?

PAR: What shall be capable of?

HV05: a 3rd degree reader.

PAR: laughter I do not understand the question, what shall be capable of...well, I do not know.
Silence

[00:19:18.26]

PAR: I do not understand that question of what shall be capable a good reader... but I imagine
that...being a good reader is being... I do not know how to explain myself.

[00:19:39.11]

HV05: What are some of the questions that you ask Child A when you talk about some of the books
with him?

PAR: What did you learn form the book?

HV05: Uh-huh

PAR: And then he explains me what the book is about. And then I tell him "You see, you can learn" and
then he says "Yes, mommy" and then he explains me more about the book.

[00:20:15.16]

HV05: Anything else?

PAR: Hmm, sometimes he tells me that he does like reading, but I ask him why then I should be pressing
him to read as he does not reads by himself, he says the he gets bored and ask him why, because is
school is great.

HV05: But he gets bored in school or he gets bored reading.

PAR: He says that he does not like reading very much, only if I tell him to do it. I tell him that he must
read and do his homework. I do not why he is like that. Laughs

PAR: Uhh, well he likes to play with the children and umm... I must order he to read because he does not like reading ver
HV05: Ok.
PAR: I must tell him " Child A, you must read" or putting him to make his homework.


01-APM
*FROM OPEN-ENDED INTERVIEW*

*HV1: So new problem. If you were to think about a typical day for Child D, from the time he gets up
to the time he goes to bed, what would that look like?

*PAR: During school it’s get up, get dressed, get ready for school, go to school, come back home, he
does his homework first thing when he gets home, and then any kind of chores, and weekdays he
doesn’t watch TV at all so he either has to read or find something else to do. And then he goes to bed.

*HV1: Okay. And we’re interested in learning more about his book and his reading interests and I
know he’s showing (Home Visitor) some of his books now. And our question for you is where have you
gotten most of these books from?

*PAR: Family.

*HV1: Like gifts, or over the holiday?

*PAR: Yeah gifts, we usually go to the, we find books at the book sales, you know used book sales or
whatever, we just get a whole bunch of kid’s books, they start getting them at garage sales and whatnot.

*HV1: Okay, great. What if anything do you do when you see that Child D is having a hard time with a
book?

*PAR: Right now when he reads to me for school or whatnot he reads out loud to me so he can
understand it because when he reads to himself he doesn’t pay attention to things too well. So if I can
tell he’s reading words and not understanding what is being said I’ll make him go back and try to
comprehend what he’s going through.

*HV1: And what are some questions that you ask him when you talk to him about books that he’s
read?

*PAR: If he understands what he’s read, does he understand what is going on, I mean, when they said
they went and did something, does he understand what they went and did? Right now I’m to the point
where now I’m asking him who the main characters are and who, where they are, like where the story’s
taking place at, overall trying to figure out that he understands what’s going on.

*HV1: Okay, so that you know that he’s not just flying through. Okay, and what if anything do you do
to motivate him to read?

*PAR: I don’t really call it motivation, it’s more like you have to do it. It’s not, I will say I don’t really
motivate him to do much. He needs to read, he needs to understand what he’s doing, so.

*HV1:

So it’s more just like tough love, this is what you’re going to do.

*PAR:

I probably should do it the other way, but -

*HV1: You know there are no shoulds, we’re here, how do parents _________, do they motivate, do
they incentify, do they just tell them to do it? So that’s helpful. Are there other people in the room that
help him with reading?

*PAR:

Not really.

*HV1: Okay, and how do you know if he’s done a good job with reading a book?

*PAR: If he can easily tell me what’s happened in the book. If he can tell me exactly what’s going on, if
he can pretty much repeat word for word what he’s being _______

*HV1:

Any other indicators for you?

*PAR: He actually likes to read them over again, he wants to read the “Diary of Wimpy Kid” over and
over again, even though he’s read it four times, he wants to read it again.

*HV1: Man, that must be a good book. And what do you think makes a good third grade reader? So
what should a good third grade reader be able to do?

*PAR: I think they should be able to comprehend, I think that’s the big part. They should be able to
comprehend for the most part what the story’s telling or what is being written. Comprehension would
probably be the best one.

*HV1:

Okay. And how would you describe Child D’s reading skills?

*PAR: He’s a good reader when he wants to be. He’s not the best at comprehension right now. He can
read the words, he can read big words. He can read it and he’ll actually go back and tell you how a story
is, but if you ask him a specific question he can’t answer it without going back through the whole thing
and out loud to you and then telling you what it is. So he gets, he gets it but not if you ask a direct
questions.

*HV1: Got it. And what goals do you have in terms of reading this summer?

*PAR: I want him to be able to learn how to enjoy reading and not think of it as something he has to
do. I mean I grew up on reading when I was in school for fun too, because my parents did it for fun. I
want him to be able to enjoy reading and not think of it as a chore or something he has to do, a
punishment so to speak. And for him to understand, be able to comprehend better, without having to
go back and see the whole story again before he understands what’s going on.

*HV1: Okay, those are all my questions for you. Anything I haven’t asked that you’d like to say or
address?

*PAR:

I can’t think of anything.


01_BBQ
*open-ended*
We want to know a little bit about the kinds of things that you and him do in your everyday routine.
What is a typical day for him – since the morning ‘til the bedtime?

*PAR: What is a difficult time?

*HV1: What are the typical things that he does during the day? His routine.

*PAR: Typical things that we do? Well, his routine is we get up very early.

*HV1: Uh-huh.

*PAR: Prepares himself for school and reads before he leaves. He reads at least 30 minutes in the
morning and makes sure his homework is done. Eats breakfast. I mean dresses and eats breakfast. And
then off to school.

Then he comes home. Every day is like a routine during the week. They come home, do their
homework, and then if there’s enough time, I let 'em go outside to the park. Yeah.

*HV1: Uh-huh.

*PAR: Now in summertime, since the days are longer now, they can go out. But they go to bed early.
They actually, by themselves, go to bed before the sun sets – he and his sister. That’s the routine.

*HV1: Okay. What kind of books does he have around in the house to read?

*PAR: Well, he has the little –

*HV1: What does he like to read and –?

*PAR: He loves – he is the kind of guy who loves to read – he loves to read, you know, wrestling
magazines. There’s a variety of things he reads.

*HV1: Those books that he’s giving to her – he’s showing to her – how did he get them?

*PAR: Oh, he goes – he checks 'em out at the library – or his sister. She’s in the second grade. And we
check 'em out from the library. His sister checked that book out.

But he’s the one that’s reading it. Because it’s a little bit too much for her. So he’s been reading that
book. And that’s what they do. They get 'em from the library.

*HV1: Uh-huh. What kind of things do you do to help him be a good reader?

*PAR: Well, actually what I do – basically, what I do to help him be a good reader is I trust the teachers
and school, and I take their suggestions on.

And I enroll him – and I put tutors – or Reading Academy, plus the different programs they have at the
school. ___ program. After school programs that help them.

*HV1: What kinds of things – if you do things for him to make more time to read –?

*PAR: I don’t understand your question.

*HV1: What, if anything, do you do to help your child to make time for reading?

*PAR: Well, there’s always time for him to read. And I guess I make him read.

*HV1: Uh-huh. You make him read?

*PAR: Yeah. I make him read. You know? It’s not a punishment. It’s just a requirement. I want him
to read.

*HV1: Yeah. Do you help him with the words that he doesn’t know?

*PAR: Yes, I do, when they ask –

[Inaudible]

*HV1: Yeah? Okay. What do you do when he has a hard time with a book, if sometimes he has –? If
he doesn’t, it’s okay.

*PAR: Well, I tell you. You see these are – I have three grandchildren that live with me – my daughter’s
children.

*HV1: Uh-huh.

*PAR: And you know it’s kind of difficult. He was having problems in school. But I know that he’s
intelligent. But he just was lazy.

So what I would do is sort of like what my mom used to do with me ___ ____ ____. If he didn’t get
something right, he would be punished for it.

*HV1: Uh-huh.

*PAR: And once I started putting that in it, he started passing every test they would give him at school.
You know? Just being strict on disciplinary actions – which may not be approved of by some.

But it worked for him. Because now he knows what happens if he doesn’t perform well.

*HV1: Uh-huh.

*PAR: And he’s excelling in school. He’s doing a lot better.

*HV1: Well, good. What kinds of questions do you ask him after he reads – about the books or the
things that he reads?

*PAR: Well, he actually comes to me and tells me about what he’s read.

*HV1: Awesome.

*PAR: And we have a little discussion about it. You know? I mean like I can’t say that I’m the best
granddaddy to have. Because I was living here by myself, until they came. So I was forced into the
situation where I have to raise them.

So they’re beginning to – they’ve been with me now for – the little guy, he’s three now. So he’s been
with me since he was six months. And his sister is back there – eight years old.

*HV1: Uh-huh.

*PAR: So they’ve come a long way, really.

*HV1: And how do you motivate him to read?

*PAR: Well, I talk to him. I talk to him a lot about what life is about, about how far reading can get
you. And by not reading – where you would be.

And I use people as examples. You know? You have people out there that are examples of what not to
be like. And I let him see that – that you have a choice. You can either do this, or you can do that.
Excuse me.

[Interruption]

*HV1: Are there other people at home that help you with the reading and the activities with them?

*PAR: Here? No. It’s just me.

*HV1: It’s just you?

*PAR: Me and three little children.

*HV1: Okay. Wow.

*PAR: Yeah.

*HV1: Well, let’s go and start with these questions.

*PAR: Okay.

*HV1: The first one will be – how do you describe him as a child? What does he like? What does he
do?

*PAR: Well, I describe him as a child –

*HV1: What kind of person is he?

*PAR: He is like his name – sincere. He’s not quite as sincere or truthful as I would like him. He’s very
humble – very humble and easygoing.

*HV1: Uh-huh.

*PAR: He has a desire to learn. He wants to learn, like Child S.

*HV1: What does he like to do the most?

*PAR: Let me see. He loves to get away from me.

[Laughter]

On the weekends. But I think what he likes to do the most is just play. Have fun.

*HV1: Play?

*PAR: Yeah. Have fun.

*HV1: What are some of your favorite things to do with him?

*PAR: Take him to work with me. He loves to work and make – earn some money for himself.

*other excerpts from home visit*
*HV1: And how often do you take him to the library?
*PAR: I haven’t –
[Inaudible]
Well, I mean I make sure they go. Like my daughter – their aunt – she comes and takes them to those.
They take 'em – other people.


01-BFX
*FROM OPEN-ENDED INTERVIEW*
*HV1: Okay. Now I’m just gonna ask you some open ended questions and you just answer however
you’d like, so first question, we are interested in knowing the kinds of things that you and Child D do just
in your everyday routine. I’m gonna ask you to tell me about a typical day for Child D from morning to
bedtime.
*PAR: Okay. I get him up at 7:30 in the morning. I iron his clothes. Well, I iron his clothes at night. I
iron his clothes. We’ll sit down and watch TV ‘til it’s 8:15 ‘til it’s time for his bus to come. Then around
8:20 his bus’ll come and then I’ll be heading out the door right behind him because I’ve gotta take my
little girl to school too, because she goes to Park, so that’s on the west end.
He come home from school. He’ll come in and do his homework. He’ll give me the papers that he got
from ______ father for me to sign or read and whatever. I’ll sign it and then he’ll come and watch TV.
He’ll eat, and then he’ll be ready to go outside and play. That’s what he be doing.
*HV1: Okay, and what happens when he gets back from inside?
*PAR: Okay, when they get back inside, you see what he did? He’ll be sitting here, wanting to watch
TV.
*HV1: Okay, and then I think you had said earlier then he’ll take a bath.
*PAR: Yeah.
*HV1: Tell me right up until bedtime, what happens?
*PAR: Okay, he’ll take his bath. Okay, when it get to the evening, when they come in, it’s around 7:00
or 7:30. 8:00 he’s taking his bath. 8:30, he’s watching TV or he might get a book to read or something.
He might do something. I don't know.
He might do something up in his room and then they ____ _____ no. I tell him it’s 9:30 and then he say,
“Okay, mom. I’m getting ready to wind down,” and I say, “Yeah, because 10:00 you in the bed because
you know we gotta get up at 7:30 in the morning.”
*HV1: Okay.
*PAR: So that’s what we be doing.
*HV1: That’s very helpful.
*PAR: That’s what we do over and over.
*HV1: Every day.
*PAR: Over and over. I get so tired.
*HV1: Sorry.
*PAR: You ain’t gonna hurt me. It’s okay.

*HV1: Thank you. Okay, so next question, we’re interested in learning more about Child D’s books and
his reading interests and I know you had already mentioned snakes. So far I know that Child D has been
asked to show (Home Visitor) some of his books right now, so our question for you is where did your
child get most of his books from?
*PAR: Okay, my sister, she had some books when her son was a baby. Wait a minute. When her son
was a baby, so she had some books stashed back.
*HV1: Okay.
*PAR: And she gave some to Child D and her, but she decided to scribble ______ in them.
*HV1: Hello. Oh. Thank you.
*PAR: So he’ll look at them. They’re right there in that closet right there. He’ll look at them and then
he’ll read it and then he’ll say, “Mom, I read this book before.” I’m like, “Okay, you read it. What’s that
one about?” He say, “Yeah.” He’ll sit down and tell me what it’s about and then I’ll say, “Okay. Let me
read it. Let me see what you’re talking about there.” That’s what we be doing over and over.
*HV1: And I know that’s how a lot of people get books, is from relatives who already have children.
Any other sources we should know about?
*PAR: No.
*HV1: Okay. Do you need to ____ ___ ______ (background conversations).
*PAR: Then I can’t look at it. Then I can’t see it.
*PAR: Child A, stop being like that. Go upstairs and watch TV.
*HV1: Okay, next question. What are some things that you do to help Child D become a good reader?
*PAR: I sit down. I read the book first and then I’ll say repeat after me, what I just read to you, and
then he’ll go along with it. I had this other ______ when he was little was teaching him how to read
before he started school. She had came to my house. Not this house.
This is when I lived in County. She had came to my house and she was helping him out, how to read and
stuff. A lot of reading, helping him how to read and everything, and then when he went to school, the
teacher said, “I’m so proud of him. He learned how to read early.” I said, “Yes, he did.”
*HV1: So I hear you saying that you’ll read the book first and you’ll ask him questions about what he’s
read and that's great. Anything else we should know about?
*PAR: No.
*HV1: Okay When you see that Child D is struggling with a book, he’s having a hard time with it, what
do you do then, if anything?
*PAR: Okay, if he’s having a hard time and don’t understand a book, then I’ll sit down and say, “Let me
read it first.” Then I’ll tell him a little bit about the book and then I tell him to read it and see if he
catches on to what I’m talking about.

*HV1: Okay.
*PAR: Then he’s like, “Yeah, okay, mama. I picked it up. I see what you’re talking about.” I’ll say, “I’m
glad you did.”
*HV1: Okay, all right. Next question, what are some questions that you ask Child D when you talk to
him about books that he has read?
*PAR: I’d be like, “Child D, when they go to library at school, did you read that book,” because they
usually send a paper home for him to answer them questions and I’m like, “Did you read the book?” He
say, “Yes,” and I’ll say, “Let me see your paper and let me read the question and you fill in the blank.
Once you ____ _____ have read, let me read the question and you fill in the blank,” because I already
read the book. I’d be like, “I already read it.” I just wanna see if he write down the same things we’re
both thinking of.
*HV1: Okay. Then my last question, what, if anything, do you do to motivate Child D to read?
*PAR: Oh, we have to sweet talk ___ _____.
*HV1: Say again?
*PAR: Sweet talk him.
*HV1: How do you encourage him?
*PAR: Child D, if you read, I’ll buy you this or I’ll buy you that, and he’s like, “Okay, mama, I’ll read this
book.” I’ll say, “Okay. Now we’re gonna do some questions. I’m gonna write down some questions and
I’m gonna see if you can fill in the answers.” That’s what ___ _____ _____.
*HV1: Okay. Well, that is the end of my questions for you. Thank you. We’re just gonna get Child D
and (Home Visitor) back in here and we’ll do the last thing together.

*OTHER CODED EXCERPTS FROM HOME VISIT*
*HV1: Yeah and what are some of your favorite things to do with Child D?
*PAR: Me with Child D? Me and him be playing games together. We’ll play games together. We’ll sit
down and play cards together. We’ll watch Wheel of Fortune and try to solve the problem on TV, but do
that. I’m like, “Child D, try to figure out what’s the next letter,” and he’ll be calling out the letter and I’ll
say, “Okay, you got that. What’s the word?”
Then he’ll say it and I’ll say, “That's it right there.” We’ll sit down and do things together. We’ll play
little games, Monopoly games, Uno, spades, whatever he wanna do. We’ll do it or we’ll play ball
together. I get tired, though, but I play ball with him.
**
*HV1: And what is one of Child D’s favorite books?
*PAR: Snakes.
*HV1: Is that the title or is that a subject?
*PAR: That’s what he likes to bring home, books about snakes, and I’ll be telling him, “Don’t bring no

more books about snakes because I don’t go over there.”
*HV1: Of all his snake books, is there one that he really likes the most?
*PAR: Anaconda? What y’all call them snakes, them orange and red and black snakes? He likes that
kind. What’s the name of the snake, cobras?
*CHI: Yes.
*PAR: Cobra books.
*HV1: So books about cobras?
*PAR: Mm-hmm. He loves snakes. That’s why I was like, “Uh-uh.”
**
*HV1: Oh, okay, so number ten, how often do you buy Child D books, never or hardly ever, once or twice
a year, three or four times a year, at least once a month?
*PAR: I’mma put A, never, hardly ever, because he wants some toys.
*HV1: You’re like, “That’s where the money’s going.”
*PAR: Mm-hmm. He want his toys, his wrestling men.


01-BAK

*HV1: Okay, thank you. Just let me write this down. And next I just have a series of open-ended
questions again. So we're interested in knowing what kinds of things you and Child N do in your
everyday routine. So if you were to think about it, just an average day for Child N from the time she gets
out of bed to the time she goes back to bed, can you kinda walk me through that?

*PAR: Yeah. She's pretty good now. She'll kinda get herself up and get herself ready for school, or if
it's the weekends, whatever, she does it all on her own as far as brushing her teeth and picking out her
clothes and stuff like that. If it's a school day, she'll do all of that, and my husband usually fixes
breakfast for her, so she'll eat like that. On the weekends, same sorta thing, just kinda have breakfast at
leisure.

So then she'll go to school. When we come home from school, she gets a snack, and then as soon as the
snack is over, it's right to homework. And she might spend – she's gotten – at the beginning of the year
she could easily spend an hour to an hour and a half, two hours on homework, but now the end of the
year where she's really gotten – understanding the material and stuff, now she can come home, work on
her homework, and be done in 30 or 40 minutes.

So she'll get her homework done, and like I said, we make her read every day for 30 minutes after
school. And then it's either karate or – like I said, you could look at her checklist if you want to, but if
she doesn't have karate, then she'll usually have one simple chore, like maybe straightening up her
room or something like that, so a pretty simple chore. Again, earlier in the year I was making her – I had
a bunch of little workbooks. So if it was a non-karate day, then I would make her do a page or two out
of the workbooks, which – like reading, math, or writing. I was really trying to work with her on her
handwriting for a little while, and I kinda gave up on that.

So like I said, that's pretty much it. Get herself ready for school. She's very independent with that.
Come home. And especially with the checklist, we don't even really have to say, "Child N, you need to
do this, that." She just knows automatically, "Check my checklist," and she's kinda really independent
with that. And then by the time all that's done, it's dinnertime, hang out as a family for a little bit, and
then she goes to bed.

*HV1: Great. Okay, that's helpful. Thank you. And we're interested in learning more about Child N's
books and her reading interests. I know you've seen her showing (Home Visitor) some stuff right now.

*PAR: Mm-hmm.

*HV1: And our question for you is, where has she gotten most of her books from?

*PAR: Most of those books upstairs probably came from either a school, like a book fair, or some kinda
secondhand store, like maybe a – I would say most of them would probably come from a book fair. And
then she gets some from – I would say maybe Parent T would be like – we always try to get her a book
for Christmas or her birthday or something like that, and then like I said, like a Goodwill or something
like that. Those two probably tie as far as how much came from those sorts of places.

*HV1: And what are some things that you do to help her become a good reader?

*PAR: To help her become a good reader? I think definitely things like asking her questions about
what she's reading. I mean, she loves to kinda tell us just automatically about a part that she think is
funny or something, so we definitely try to engage with her when she comes to us with something like
that. We try to make a point of stopping and paying attention to what she's saying, especially when it's
reading.

But like I said, just trying to take her places and kinda encouraging her to read about it. Like if we go to
the museum, it's not just like run through the museum and just run and play. It's like, "Let's stop and
read what this little plaque says about the frog." So we just are trying to kinda incorporate it every day,
all around, and then having times where we are actually focused on it in one way or another.

*HV1: And what, if anything, do you do when you see that she's having a hard time with a book?

*PAR: If she's having a hard time with a book? Similar sorta thing where we'll kinda sit down, and in
those instances, we would read the book with her more. And I try to encourage her to not give up on a
book. I remember a couple of summers – last summer, actually. Last summer. She was reading so
much. I mean, she was just going through books like crazy, and she would get a hard one that she would
wanna give up on, so she might move on to another one without me knowing. And so when I realized
she had moved on, I'm not gonna fuss and say, "You can't move on," but I will kinda go back and say,
"Well, what's up with this book?" and try to encourage her to stay on it or say – like I said, I might say,
"Well, we can read this one together," that sorta thing. So I was always trying to encourage her to finish
a book, like once she start, finish it.

*HV1: So checking in to make sure she hadn't just breezed through it, but that she'd really taken the
time.

*PAR: Right, right. But spending more time with her on the book and trying to help her kinda get
through it would probably be the most thing that we do.

*HV1: And what are some questions – you've already talked about this a little bit. What are some
questions that you ask her when you talk with her about books that she's read?

*PAR: I always wanna know who she likes the most, what character does she like the most in the story.
I guess I probably should tell you that I used to be an English teacher.

*HV1: Oh, really?

*PAR: I should've said that at the beginning. Yeah, I used to be an English teacher, so all that sort of
"What's your favorite character?"

*HV1: You're like, "I know what questions to ask."

*PAR: Yeah.

*HV1: "I've got this down."

*PAR: Uh-huh, uh-huh. Or just in general, "Tell me what's happening in the story," and if maybe the
story doesn't make sense, then I kind of – what she's telling me, I kinda go back and be like, "So what
happened first, though? And then what happened? I'm not sure that I understand what you're saying."
So kinda just paying attention to the story and kinda trying to push her, be on it. Sometimes I ask her
the sorta analytical, like "Why do you think this happened?" sorta thing. But for the most part, it's just
asking her to tell us what the story's about, summarize what the story's about. And usually, I always ask,
"What's your favorite part? What's your favorite character?" That sorta thing.

*HV1: So you're no longer an English teacher?

*PAR: Mm-mmm. No, I'm a counselor now.

*HV1: Are you?

*PAR: Mm-hmm.

*HV1: Like mental health counseling?

*PAR: Mm-hmm. Yeah, we work mostly with kids and teens, and do a lot of family therapy.

*HV1: Wonderful. Can I ask what your background is?

*PAR: Well, like I said, my bachelor's is in secondary education, high school education. And I taught
high school for a little while and taught middle school for a little while. And then I got my master's in
counseling, so yeah, I'm just doing that now.

*HV1: I'm getting my master's in social work right now so that I can be a family therapist down the
road, so I always get excited when I meet other counselors. That's wonderful. I debated long and hard
between social work and then just the general counseling degree, which would've been a more
straightforward route. Did you go to (School) for that or...?

*PAR: For my master's?

*HV1: Yeah.

*PAR: No, I went to (School).

*HV1: Nice, I've heard really good things about that program.

*PAR: It's awesome. Yeah.

*HV1: Oh, cool. And you've already addressed this a little bit as well, but what, if anything, do you do
to motivate Child N to read?

*PAR: To motivate her to read? Just taking her places, like taking her to the library. Yeah, taking her
to the library or just reading with her. I mean, I never, ever, ever tie reading to a reward or a
punishment. I've never, ever, ever said, "Well, you're getting on my nerves today. Go to your room and
read." You know, like that. I know that's dangerous, so I've never tied it to a punishment, and I've never
tied it to a reward either. It's never been like, "Read a book and then I'll buy you a –" It's just trying to
encourage her to just read because you enjoy reading.

So I mean, the big – just letting her see us read, and if I'm reading something interesting or funny, I kinda
pull her into what I'm reading too and tell her about my story. Like I said, I love to read middle schoollevel novels and stuff, so I'm always kinda telling her about what I'm reading. So that's basically it. I
don't know. She just kinda rolls with it, thankfully. I haven't had to do a – it hasn't been like a tug of war
with her to get her to read.

*HV1: And are there other people in the home that help her with her reading? And if so, what do they
do to help?

*PAR: Yeah, my husband, he helps her with reading as well. He just does pretty much the same stuff
that I said: sharing with her what he's reading, asking her questions about what she's reading. If she's
having a problem understanding some vocabulary or something like that, walking her through that sorta
thing. So pretty much the same stuff that I'm saying, he does with her, just making sure he spends time
with her as well.

*HV1: And how do you know if Child N has done a good job of reading a book?

*PAR: She's able to give us a kinda really clear summary of it. She knows the characters. She doesn't
get the characters confused. Yeah, that's pretty much it. She can really talk about it. Especially if she
can, like I said, sorta analyze it, maybe go a little bit deeper than just the storyline, like if she can kinda
say to us, "Oh, he did that because he was really mad" or any sort of – that's sort of demonstrating that
she's really got – not just read it, but really got I guess the – what's the word I'm looking for? Just sorta
analyzing it deeper, that sorta thing.

*HV1: That's a very helpful explanation. And what, in your opinion, makes a good third-grade reader?
So what should a good third-grade reader be able to do?

*PAR: A good third-grade reader. I think a good third-grade reader should be able to sit down and
have at least 20 minutes of sustained reading. I think that's reasonable for a third grader. I think a third
grader should – I don't know. Say it one more time so I can get the full question.

*HV1: Yeah, what should a good third-grade reader be able to do?

*PAR: Okay. So some good sustained reading I think is important. And then, like I said, be able to
kinda explain not just the characters, but kinda explain sort of a deeper side, maybe have a better
understanding of why the characters might be the way they are. They definitely should be able to
maybe relate to the story, not just saying – yeah. Relate to it in a way to say, "This reminds me of
something in my life." I don't know. I think they should be able –

*HV1: That makes very clear sense.

*PAR: – to relate to it, and yeah. Yeah, more than just being able to say, "This happened, then this
happened, then that happened," but to demonstrate that they kinda have a mental picture of the story
is really –

*HV1: More than just a superficial grasp.

*PAR: Right, right. Mm-hmm.

*HV1: And how would you describe Child N's reading skills?

*PAR: I think she's got really good reading skills. There are some places where – I guess where I start
to wonder is more along the lines of the writing side, so I wonder – because of some of her writing,
maybe her spelling or something like that. I wish that maybe she was picking up the spelling from the
reading, you see what I'm saying? That she's not necessarily – even though she might know the
vocabulary words. I think she does a really good job of even stuff like using context clues, like if she
doesn't know what a word means. I think she's a pretty good reader. I wouldn't say – I don't know. I
would say probably above average from what I know as a teacher. I would probably say above average,
but I don't know what the standards are anymore, either. Yeah.

*HV1: And last question: What goals do you have for Child N's reading over the summer?

*PAR: Like I said, I know last summer she was – I don't know, was it last summer or two summers ago?
Anyway, one summer she read probably a novel a week. I mean, they were really short novels, like to
100- or 120-page sorta novels a week. But she would read one a week or maybe every two weeks. So
that would be something I would like to see her do is maybe read a novel a week or every two weeks,
but I definitely plan to continue to hold her to a standard of reading 20 to 30 minutes every day. Yeah.

*HV1: Those are all my questions for you. Thank you. And I think they're almost done. Let me just go
check, if you would just _______________. And should I have taken my shoes off in the house?

*PAR: No. No, it's fine.


01-ANA

*HV1: Okay. Alright. That’s the first set of questions. So we’re interested in knowing the kinds of
things you and your third-grader do in your everyday routine. So tell me about a typical day for Child A
from morning to bedtime, as well as you can remember.

*PAR: Well, in the morning, she gets up to school – go to school. She comes home. She gets a snack.
She does her homework. If the weather’s feasibly, she might go outside with her friends for a little
while. She eats dinner.

She might read or do some type of schoolwork. Then she takes a shower and gets ready for bed. And
she might read a book and fall asleep.

*HV1: Okay. And we’re interested in learning more about your child’s books and reading interests. So
Child A is outside showing (Home Visitor) some books. Where did you get most of her books from? So
from the school library? The public library? Did you buy them? Did someone else give them to her? Or
did the school give them to her?

*PAR: The ones she got here were a gift. And mostly, I buy 'em.

*HV1: Most of – you buy? Okay. And what are some things that you do to help Child A become a good
reader?

*PAR: Try to explain to her what – to grasp the meaning of what she’s reading, to understand what
she’s reading, to _____ what it’s saying. It means more to that – try to get her to comprehend the
content of what she’s reading.

*HV1: Right. Okay. And what, if anything, do you do when your child has a hard time with a book?

*PAR: Try to break it down into some type of syllables. Try to break it down for her – she’s got to
comprehend the beginning, the middle, and the end.

*HV1: Right. Okay. And what are some questions that you ask your child when you talk about books
that she has read?

*PAR: What does she understand about it? What she didn’t understand about it. What did she gain
from it? How did it affect her with her personal life? What enjoyment it gave her. Or would she read
the book again.

*HV1: Okay. Okay. And what, if anything, do you do to motivate Child A to read?

*PAR: Nothing really. Child A just picks up on it. It’s just always, constantly telling her, “Do your
homework or go read a book.” You know? “If this is what you want to be, you need to do this.”

*HV1: Right.

*PAR: You know? So it’s just – she’s self-motivated. You know what I’m saying?

*HV1: Right. Okay.

*PAR: You know that _____ ____ to force her to read. You don’t have to force her. You know
sometimes you might have to stay on top of her on her concentration, and focus in on what you’re
doing.

Because she’ll do what she can do in math, and then all of a sudden, she’ll stop and do this.

*HV1: Right.

*PAR: So you have to keep her focused on what she’s doing.

*HV1: Right. Okay. And are there other people in your home that help Child A with reading?

*PAR: My wife. My daughter. My self, when I get the time.

*HV1: And what do they do to help?

*PAR: Probably listen to her. Read to her. Explain things to her – what she’s reading. You know?
Probably tell her what – correct her on some words she might say wrong. Or give her understanding on
some words. You know?

*HV1: Uh-huh.

*PAR: Because some words, she may – in other words, she might say a word, but she may want to
know what it means –

*HV1: Uh-huh.

*PAR: To help her with reading.

*HV1: Okay. And how do you know if your child has done a good job reading a book?

*PAR: By the way she – once I read to her – when she explains it to me.

*HV1: Uh-huh.

*PAR: If she’s focusing in on what it’s really saying. Or if she’s just saying something out of the great
blue sky.

*HV1: Right. Right. Absolutely. Okay. And what makes a good third-grade reader? And what should
a good reader be able to do?

*PAR: Practice. Constantly read. Regardless of what it is, just read.

*HV1: Uh-huh.

*PAR: You know? Just motivate her to read, read, read. Again, once they get that concept, it’ll carry
on with 'em through life. You know?

*HV1: Okay.

*PAR: I don’t try to push it on her to read like it’s a chore, like it’s a burden on her.

*HV1: Right.

*PAR: I tell her to read for enjoyment.

*HV1: Right. Absolutely. Okay. And how would you describe your child’s reading skills?

*PAR: I would say she’s _____ _____. I’d say satisfactory. I’d say she’s more up on a fourth grade,
closer to fifth grade level of reading.

*HV1: Okay.

*PAR: Because on the end of grade test, she was like seven points away from being a 4.

*HV1: Okay. Good.

*PAR: You know? About eight, nine points away from getting a 4 in math. So she’s – she did real
good. You know?

*HV1: Yeah. That’s great. And what goals do you have for your child’s reading this summer?

*PAR: To keep her focused on going to this other school. So don’t let her – what she learned die down.
Try to keep her motivated.

*HV1: Right.

*PAR: You know? Try to keep her as smart as she _____. Pretty soon, she’s got to go back to school,
so I’m trying to get her to read more on this level.

*HV1: Uh-huh.

*PAR: You know? Okay. “You’re gonna read? Just read – just go to the next level.”

*HV1: Right. Okay. So that’s good. So we’re just gonna wait for them to finish up.

*PAR: Okay. So that’s it?

*HV1: Yes. That’s all the questions for you.

*PAR: Alright.


01-BCN
*excerpts from overall home visit*
How many nights a week Child B reads before bedtime?
PAR: Well, he practically reads every day because he goes to school, I mean, he attends an after-school
program after regular school, then he gets home at 6:00 pm. They are teaching him how to read more¾
[0:2:59]
HV1: And when he gets here and has dinner and all that, how many times does he read after he gets
home until he goes to bed?
PAR:Well, like I tell the teacher, when he gets home I don’t make him read, because like says he gets
here late, he gets home at 6:00, has dinner, then he does homework and then he takes a bath and he
has no time to read. But he reads practically every day.
**
HV1: Okay, more than ten. How nice. Um, how often do you read with the boy.
PAR: Well, since all the books are in English… but I’m there with him. My other son is the one who reads
with him, his brother, but I’m there listening to what he reads.
HV1: You are listening to him reading.
PAR: To him reading, yes. Since I can’t read to him, and since his brother reads to him and then tells him
it’s his turn to read¾
[0:05:00]
**
HV1: Uh, how often do you talk to the boy about what he reads?
PAR: I ask him every day what book did he read and what did he do at school, that’s what I usually ask
him, how did it go in school, and if… what did he learn, and he tells me, “We did this”, or “We did that”,
and I’m always asking.
**
HV1: And when he reads his books here during the weekend, do you also ask him about those books he
reads?
PAR: Oh, yes. I ask him what was the book about, [0:06:01] and he tells me. And when he tells me, I tell
the other boy if that is what he read, if that is correct what he told me, since, as I’ve told you, I don’t
understand it. But the boy says that’s right, that what he told me was correct.


01-BEK
*from open-ended interview*

*HV1: Great. So that's about the first third of my questions for you. What I have left is just some
open-ended questions. So we're interested in knowing the kinds of things that you and Child J like to do
together -- or not even together, just in your everyday routine. So if you were to think about a typical
day for Child J from the time she wakes up to the time she goes to bed what would that look like?

*PAR:
On a school day basically getting up, getting ____ ready for school and when she
come home from school do her homework. A little time for either TV or reading if that's what she want
to do, then she prepare herself for bed for the next day.

*HV1: So she's gotten home from school; tell me what happens again after school?

*PAR:
She usually does her homework and then after homework that's her free time
to do whatever she's going to do. That's including if she wants to read a book, sometimes she might
want to come outside, sometimes she looking at TV, sometimes she playing a video game. Sometime
we go to the park. Yesterday we went to the park.

*HV1: It varies. It's hard to capture everything. We are interested in learning more about Child J's
books and her reading interests and what she's doing with (Home Visitor) right now is showing her some
of her books. And our question for you is where has she gotten most of her books from?

*PAR:
Well because I have five children altogether and I've always had books and read
to my children as they was younger and then while they in school they got books through the school and
I purchased some of them myself, bought some of them, people have given me some books, some
people I bought books and give it to them, they even got books for Christmas, birthdays, presents and
things. Like _______ they have a little book in there sometime instead of a toy. They get them from
different places like that.

*HV1: So here you have five children; are the three children I didn't see today older?

*PAR:
Yes, only three live here. I have two all grown that don't live here. My 15-yearold's probably in the back yard.

*HV1: Yeah, we see that a lot with younger kids, just books being passed down. And you've already
kind of alluded to this but I'm still going to ask you what are some things that you do to help Child J
become a good reader?

*PAR:
Well I read to her while I was pregnant and I read to her while she was little and
then I read myself. So I got a book in the car now I was reading earlier. Of course I ain't got time to read
it like I want to so I've been reading it for a while but when I get a chance I pick it up. I'm almost done
now but it's going to take me a couple of months to read that book because I'm not able to sit still and
read it like back to when I was younger.

*HV1: It sounds like you're saying one way you help her become a good reader is by modeling the
reading. Great. And what, if anything, do you do when you see she's having a hard time with a book?

*PAR:
I ask her to try to pronounce the words, try to sound it out like she's been
taught. Then try to see what that word might be from other words she has read already, what would
that word be to make sense in the sentence. And if she can't get it then I'll just go ahead and tell her.

*HV1: What are some questions that you ask Child J when you talk to her about books she's read?

*PAR:
I ask her what the main characters are, what the subject of it is, what took
place. Then sometimes what's your favorite part of the book or something.

*HV1: And what, if anything, do you do to motivate her to read?

*PAR:
When she complain about being bored, she don't want to play her game: "Read
a book. Read a book."

*HV1: So just always reminding her that reading is an option.

*PAR:

Yeah, reading is something you can always do.

*HV1: Sounds like she's pretty self-motivated to read anyway. You probably don't have to intervene
too often.

*PAR:
She's not one of the children that I have to really motivate that much with the
reading, no. She took to it like water.

*HV1: Are there other people in the home that help her with reading?

*PAR:

Yeah.

*HV1: Who are they and what do they do?

*PAR:
Her father, when he's around he helps. And my other child, my son, so her
brother, helps out, and he's 15. Because Child T’s only six. She helps Child T, actually, with her reading.

*HV1: Wonderful. When you're teaching something it reinforces it for yourself. I loved her hear Child
T say that math was her favorite subject. I was like, "That's awesome." You never hear that when
they're little or when they're girls they tend not to gravitate towards math as much. I was like, "Go Child
T, that's awesome." How do you know if Child J has done a good job of reading a book?

*PAR:
Because she tells me about what she's read and she actually remembers what
she read. So when she was younger she didn't always remember so she was just reading words. Now
she's actually understanding that she's reading, so now I know she's much better and doing a better job
with her reading because she _______ she done read it.

*HV1: What do you think makes a good third grade reader? What should a good third grade reader be
able to do?

*PAR:
They should be able to pick up a book and read it from cover to cover with very
little problems, very little help from an adult. Some help but not as much.

*HV1: How would you describe Child J's reading skills?

*PAR:
Very good, very good. And when she was younger she would be a little scared
and thinking she's doing it wrong but once she got the confidence knowing that she was okay she was
fine with it.

*HV1: Wow, five years old.

*PAR:

Very find with it, yes.

*HV1: I'm so impressed.

*PAR:
Actually before she actually started school she was reading stuff off the TV, like
shows. I mean with the writing, not with the pictures, you know, like you got the guide on the TV; she
can read that and tell her favorite shows, she was reading it, saying what time it came on and
everything. And she hadn't even went to no preschool, _____ time for preschool, none of that. She
actually potty trained herself. So I mean she's like -- yeah.

*HV1: She's your easy kid.

*PAR:
Yeah, that's the one. Where _____ just like really have to guide her and
encourage her when she get discouraged but as far as reading and all these other things she was pretty
much on point with these things, this one here.

*HV1: My last question for you: what goals do you have for Child J's reading this summer?

*PAR:
Well I expect her reading to be a lot more faster, since she pretty much reads
pretty good anyway I expect her to read a little more faster than she do. That's the only thing, I think
just a little more faster paced, that's it.

*HV1: Good call. Okay. Those are all my questions for you. Thank you so much.

*PAR:

No problem.

*Other coded excerpts from home visit*
*HV1: What are some of her favorite things to do?
*PAR: Reading, she do like to do that. She likes to write sometimes too, but reading she picked up on
that pretty good. I think she got that from me because I used to do a lot of reading.
*
*PAR: I don't have to do much to guide her in reading, not much. Then once she know how to sound
words out she even know how to say bigger words than her age limit on her own.
* *HV1: Good for her. What are some of your favorite things to do with Child J?
*PAR: Because _______ I don't really do as much as I would like to do with her so I guess we look at
movies sometimes together and maybe when she tell me about books that she reads and stuff and the
little time at school how you read every day, sometimes she read to me sometimes she read to herself
so I like that too.

*
*HV1: Good for her. What are some of your favorite things to do with Child J?
*PAR: Because _______ I don't really do as much as I would like to do with her so I guess we look at
movies sometimes together and maybe when she tell me about books that she reads and stuff and the
little time at school how you read every day, sometimes she read to me sometimes she read to herself
so I like that too.
*
*HV1: I understand. And what is one of her favorite books?
*PAR:

The Diary of a Wimpy Kid; she really loves those.

*HV1: That is by far the winner. We are going to be visiting 80 families for this study and I just keep
hearing that one over and over again.
*PAR: Actually I had to buy it at the last book fair. She had to have it. So I got the money together
and got it for her. Yeah, she had to have one of them, one of those books. She likes those. And she
loves chapter books, so those are her main favorite, chapter books.


01-BDH
*open-ended interview*
HV1: We are interested in learning about you and her and the things you do in your daily routines.
Please tell me, as much as you can remember, about a typical day for Child J from the moment she
wakes up until she goes to bed.
[0:21:31]
PAR: (indiscernible) or ?
HV1: A typical day, from the moment she wakes up until she goes to bed.
PAR: Well, she wakes… she wakes up, she brushes her teeth, she changes her clothes
HV1: And what time is that?
PAR: In the morning. Like around… well, since she is at school every day, she gets up, she brushes her
teeth and she changes her clothes, she combs her hair, and then she goes to school.
[0:13:06] She comes back, does her homework, eats, takes a bath, watches a little TV, and goes to bed.
Because since she gets home from school around four, she has almost no time to do things or activities.
And that is all she does. So now, since she just came from school, as I said, she’ll get up, she’ll get
dressed, and eat, and then we go out for a little while to run or something like that, because, you know,
we need to go to run, to do activities.
0:13:45] And that is all we will be doing now that they already got home from school.
HV1: We are also interested in learn more about her books and Child J’s reading interests.
PAR: Uh-huh.
HV1: She is showing (Home Visitor) some books right now. Where did she get most of those books?
PAR: At school. Every one or almost every one she has she got at school.
[0:14:16]
HV1: When you say school, do you mean from the school library, or where they given at an activity ?
PAR: I honestly don’t know what to tell you. I just see that she comes home bringing books and she tells
me that the teacher gave them to her.
[0:14:30]
HV1: The teacher gave them to her.
PAR: Yes. She tells me the teacher gave them to her. Everything she brings, when we were just coming
from school… Yesterday, she brought five books, I think, and she says she likes, that she wants to read.
So yes, only from school.
HV1: What are some of the things you do to make her a good reader?

[0:15:00]
PAR: Not much, because I hardly know how to read. Sometimes she gets home bringing books in English,
and I don’t, I don’t know. I can be of little help. The only way I help her is that I look at the book and
more or less I tell her what it is about, because since I don’t understand, I just look at it and see that
there is a girl that is playing, or that they go to the park, they are playing at the park, or something like
that, I make up the words there. [0:15:35] So then I don’t help her very much, because I can’t read very
well.
HV1: What do you do, what do you do, if anything, so she can have time to read?
PAR: What do I do so she has time to read?
HV1: Uh-huh. To dedicate it to read.
PAR: Well, sometimes I send her to her room so she can be by herself and understand the book better.
[0:16:01] Because sometimes she gets here and she wants to read here, and her sisters start
(indiscernible) or ask her to turn on the TV and make noise, and she like loses concentration, so she goes
to her room, locks the door and reads, and she reads quietly.
HV1: What do you do to help her learn the meaning of new words?
PAR: Well, I don’t know, I don’t do much because
HV1: Sorry, excuse me?
0:16:29] PAR: I don’t do much because, for example, sometimes she asks me things that are in English
and I don’t know. So I almost don’t help her, I can hardly help her as much as I would like to. Because
sometimes she asks questions that I cannot answer.
HV1: Do you do anything to help her understand what she reads? If you do anything.
PAR: Well, sometimes I look up the word there, in the computer. They help you there, there they help
you
[0:17:03]
HV1: In this computer here?
PAR: There they help you to find what a word means. So I get there
HV1: On the Internet.
PAR1: Yes. I write what she doesn’t understand and then I understand what it says in Spanish, and then I
explain it what it means. That is the only way I can help her.
[0:17:25]
HV1: What do you do when she has difficulties reading a book?
PAR: I tell her that, when she is at school, I tell her to mark it and tell the teacher that she didn’t
understand it.

HV1: To mark it, to underline it, you mean.
PAR: Yes. Oh. I tell her to mark it and tell the teacher that she didn’t understand that word, so that she
can explain it to her, because as I say, I can’t explain it to her.
HV1: What are some of the questions you ask Child J when you talk about books with her, of the books
she has read?
[0:18:03]
PAR: Uh, what was the book about, or, yes, what was the book about, or I ask her what is the book, uh,
from the beginning, how does it start and how does it end. That is what I ask, what I mostly ask her.
HV1: And what do you do to motivate her to read?
PAR: Well, I tell her to work hard so she learns more, because if she doesn’t work hard she won’t learn
anything. I tell her that I didn’t study and I know nothing, so you have to work hard, study hard so you
learn more.
HV1: Are there any other persons in the house who help her read?
PAR: No.
HV1: Okay.
[0:19:09]
HV1: How do you know if she did a good job reading a book?
PAR: Because I ask her what the book was about, and sometimes she, no, she always tells me what it
was about, she explains it to me, like there was a girl, she got lost, or what the book says. [0:19:28] She
starts explaining it to me, so I see from what she says, I look at the pictures and I realize that definitely
what she is telling me is correct.
HV1: What are your reading goals for her during the summer?
[0:20:00]
PAR: Uh, study more, read more with her so she learns more how to read.
HV1: What else?
PAR: Uh, (baby crying) (to baby) Sh.
HV1: Oh, she wants the machine. I don’t want her to press it. [0:20:30] (to baby) Do you want it? I’m
going to give it to you later.
PAR: (laughter)

*other coded excerpts from home visit*

HV1: What are some of the favorite activities you do with Child J?
HV1: Read. Read with her, because sometimes she doesn’t understand some words, and then I, how do
you say, I research the letter [sic] she doesn’t understand. And, and helping her with homework. It’s the
same with homework, when she doesn’t know, I um, I help her, I mean, to look up the letters [sic]. What
she doesn’t understand I look it up in the computer to be able to help her.

01_AFQ
*From open-ended interviews*
HV1: I work with children, and it seemed very interesting to me to come into the studio and visit
families, because it takes me away from home and it gives me the opportunity to see other families in
the state I visited a few years ago, and help in some way, and also to get to know a little bit. We would
like to know what do you and Child M do in your daily life.[0:00:33] As a third-grader, how is her life, her
routine.
PAR1: Her routine in the mornings is that she leaves home, I take her to get the bus that will take her to
school, and when she comes back from school she goes to my sister’s house, because I’m working. She
goes to my sister’s house, and then I pick her up about an hour later, after I get off from work. We get
home and normally I ask her to do her homework first.
[0:01:01] I have to force her, but she gets her homework done, and goes out to play with a next-door
neighbor, and then I have to go get her to come home and take a bath, eat dinner and go to bed. We do
that daily, but some days we go to the park, or last month she took swimming lessons, and we would eat
a quick dinner, go back home and do her homework.
[0:01:27] But for reading, as much as I would tell her, “We are going home and you’ll do some reading”,
and I would make her do it, but she wouldn’t read for even 15 minutes and she’d say, “I’m finished, I
read three books”, and although they were short books, she wouldn’t read more. At bedtime, I would
grab the Bible, although for a very short time, so she would read at least from the Bible, something
(laughter). But after five or ten minutes she would say, “I’m tired, I’m going to bed”, and she would
never read the 30 or 40 minutes they recommended at school for her to read. She would always say,
“No more than 20 or 25”.
[0:02:02] And I had to argue with her every day, but as a mother, I would tell her nicely, “It’s okay”. But
there were days where I would make her read for 40 minutes or an hour when I was mad at her. But
normally it wasn’t more than 25 minutes.
HV1: Okay. Fine. My partner (Home Visitor) is talking to Child M about the books she reads and all that,
and she is going to ask her to bring books, she is going to look at them and take notes, and they are
going to talk about those books. [0:02:37] I would like to know how did you get those books she has at
home, where did you get them from.
PAR1: We got most of the books from garage sales, or the second-hand stores, and I have bought her
some, but the ones I bought for her, that was a long time ago and she knows them by heart, the Curious
George ones, but the other ones are from school, she sometimes brings them from school, but not
always. [0:03:03] And sometimes, but not very often, we have been at the library and we have brought
them from the library.
HV1: What are the things you do to make her a better reader?
PAR1: Well, generally, almost always, I try to be with her when she is reading. The only downside is that
I don’t know what to ask her, and I don’t know if she understood what she read, but I ask her, “What
was the name of the character in the book” [0:0:35]. But I always, always, always ask her, “Who is the

author of the book”? But she rarely knows it. But I hardly ask her anything about the story, because I
don’t know how to ask the questions or what to ask.
HV1: What do you do when she has difficulty reading a book?
[0:03:57]
PAR1: Wow. When she says she doesn’t understand something, I try to read it to her and explain it to
her, but sometimes many words are difficult for me, I don’t understand them, I don’t know what they
mean. I help her with most of the words’ pronunciation, although sometimes my pronunciation is not so
good, but I try to help her pronounce it correctly.
HV1: What are some of the questions you ask the child when you read the books?
[0:04:27]
PAR1: Well, what is the story about, and if she tells me there was a child in the book, what was the child
doing. And almost always, how did the story start and how did it end. I almost never ask her about the
plot, in the middle part of the book, in what happened, mostly who where the other characters in the
story and what happened at the end.
HV1: Ah-hah, what happened. Okay. And if you do anything to motivate her to read, what is it that you
do?
[0:05:01]
PAR1: I don’t believe I really do anything to motivate her, I don’t know what to do to motivate her. The
only thing I do is tell her, “Go and read”, but I don’t tell her… I sometimes have said, “I’ll buy you
something”. But she doesn’t pay much attention, because maybe she knows I’m not going to buy it
(laughter), that I’m just saying. But I haven’t found something that would really motivate her.
HV1: Are there other people at home who help her to read, who motivate her, that…
[0:05:32]
PAR1: No.
HV1: No. Only you.
PAR1: He sometimes… but I think once a year (laugh)
HV1: Ah, okay. And how do you know if your child has done a good job reading a book?
PAR1: I don’t.
HV1: What do you think a third-grader should have to be a good reader?
[0:05:58]
PAR1: Umm… to be a good reader, umm… I think that to be a good reader, first of all the child needs to
like to read, and she used to like to read when she was very young, or that I read to her. And I noticed
that in first grade she liked to read, but from second grade on, she doesn’t like to read anymore, as
much as… But when she was in Kindergarten and first grade, I read to her a lot and she read a lot and

she liked it, and I don’t know what happened, but she lost interest [0:06:35], but I think that she needs
like…
HV1: Motivation.
PAR1: motivation, or maybe books with more stories…
HV1: that she likes.
PAR1: Yes, like fantasy, which are the ones she likes the most.
HV1: This study already asked her what does she like to read and what are her interests, so let’s hope…
PAR1: That they send her that kind of books.
HV1: They will send her books at her reading level, not easier or harder [0:07:00], because that is also
important, and she is going to get books about subjects she is interested in.
PAR1: That she likes.
HV1: That is what we are hoping for, because those are two key things for her to be a good reader.
PAR1: To get interested.
HV1: Umm, how would you describe her reading abilities?
PAR1: Umm, yes, I do think she is good at reading, but the bad thing is she reads fast, and she doesn’t
pay attention to the meaning of the words [0:07:30], and that is why she doesn’t understand what it
was about, because that was even the problem… I take sides with the school, when the teacher said that
she read well, but she didn’t know what she was reading.
HV1: Ah-hah. She is lacking comprehension.
PAR1: Reading comprehension.
HV1: And what are your goals for her as a reader this summer?
[0:07:54]
PAR1: Well, I want her to be at her level, because during the whole year she was a little below her level.
At the end, she leveled with the marks they require, and I want her to be at her level. If she goes a little
above, that’s fine, but at least I want her to be at her level and not below like she was most part of the
year, the reading level.
HV1: Well, now, as you know, I’ve told you how I got here, why I’m doing this work. And I would like it
very much for you to tell me what kind of person is Child M [0:08:30] : as a girl, what does she like, what
does she enjoy.
PAR1: Well, I see her as a very introverted girl, her thoughts or her… are more at the level of a child her
age, because when we talk about things, she comes up with questions that older girl knew. I compare
her with a friend who is about her age [0:09:00] and a niece who is her age, and the girls don’t do what
she does. She is a little more alert…

HV1: More mature.
PAR1: More mature. She is very docile. Most of the time she does what I ask her to do, although not
when I tell her to, she’ll do it a little later. If I ask her to do something she’ll say, “In a little while”, but
she does it. I think she is an intelligent girl [0:09:31], but I haven’t how do you say I haven’t learned
how to mold her to use that intelligence. In other school subjects she is doing fine, she is doing fine in
everything else except reading and writing. She is below her level, that’s why I got interested in
inscribing her in the program
HV1: That’s great. What are some of her favorite activities that she likes doing?
PAR1: She loves to play outside [0:09:57], like going to the park, or swimming, playing all sports, because
she doesn’t have a specific favorite sport. She says she loves playing soccer, but she also enjoys… we
sometimes go play tennis…
PAR2: Piano
HV1: Piano? Music?
PAR: She likes music, but she likes singing a lot…
PAR2: She sings a lot. She’s good too, singing. If you want to give her a book of non-fiction, like tennis,
piano, anything…
[0:10:34]
PAR1: and the computer, of course. She loves computer games.
HV1: Ah-hah.
PAR2: Science fiction. Science fiction.
HV1: So she likes to read?
PAR: Yes. But, it’s difficult.
HV1: (laughter) Uh, okay. I am done.
PAR1: Ah, okay.
HV1: What are some favorite activities you do with the girl?
[0:10:59]
PAR1: Her most favorite?
HV1: That you do with the girl, that you do together.
PAR: Well, playing. Playing outside: soccer, baseball, also with raquets.
PAR2: We also play tennis.

HV1: And how often do you buy her books: never or almost never, once or twice a year, three to four
times a year, at least once a month?
PAR1: At least once a year. No, like two or three times a year [0:13:59]. On her birthday, for Christmas, I
like to give her a book and something more.

*open-ended*
*HV1: Okay, very nice. Excellent. Thank you. Okay, so now we’re gonna get to just some kind of open
ended questions that are a little bit less formal, so I’d love to know about just Child P’s daily routine.
What does she do from the time she wakes up until the time she goes to bed?
*PAR: She get up in the morning, get dressed, get ready for school. I’ll walk them to school. They have
morning care, so I think they’ll have either 10 or 15 minutes each morning of reading before they get a
chance to play.
*HV1: Okay.
*PAR: Then they’ll go to breakfast, and I think they get to their class at least about 15 minutes before
the other kids do, so that’s another 15 minutes that they could either read or try to go over the
homework to see what questions they didn’t understand. I think it took out probably one elective this
year so they could have more reading time at school, because now the EOG’s coming up, so they’re
trying to get the kids more reading time, so they took away one of their electives.
*HV1: What elective did they take away? Do you know?
*PAR: I think she said she’s in dance, so I think –
*HV1: That’s a fun one.
*CHI:

____ ______ dance class.

*PAR: That’s the only one that you’re in? Okay, so I think what it is, they send a paper home for the
parent to choose what electives they want their kids in, and I try to give them a variety of either dance,
science, or math, or some kind of – probably reading, so she gets additional reading and additional
math, so I think the only one they probably pulled her out was some kind of – what was the one that
you did last year? Was it chorus?
*HV1: Yes.
*PAR: Yeah, I think that’s the one that they didn’t have up there as a chosen elective was the chorus.
*HV1: That sounds like fun. Those sound like good electives, dance and chorus.
*PAR: Yeah.
*HV1: I’m jealous. Okay, so after school, what does her routine look like?
(Background conversations)
*PAR: Okay, she comes home. She do the homework. Probably read for a couple of minutes and then
she’ll go outside and want to play basketball.
*HV1: Yeah. Does she play just right outside here –
*PAR: Yeah.

*HV1: – or does she go down there?
*PAR: Yeah, right here.
*HV1: Nice. Very nice, so she plays basketball typically like – I mean I know as a kid I didn’t come in
until the sun set.
*PAR: And I think that’s what she tried to use to her advantage, because I have a street light right
there at my driveway, so they would try to be out there at least about 8:30, 9:00 when it’s dark, still
trying to play.
*HV1: Yeah, that’s right. You’ve gotta get all you can. Very nice, excellent, so we’re interested in
learning more about Child P’s books and her reading interests, so Child P is showing (Home Visitor) some
of her books right now. Where you would say your child gets most of her books from? You mentioned
she gets them from teachers and where else would you say she gets her books?
*PAR: I think the library sometimes probably gives some books away.
*HV1: Yeah.
*PAR: She’ll probably come home with one, two books, but at the end of the year I think is when she
comes home with – she’d have anywhere from 10 to 12 books that the teachers know that they’re not
gonna use no more, and they’ll give her and her sister some to read and stuff.
*HV1: Very nice, excellent, so what are some of the things that you do to help Child P become a good
reader? Any things in particular?
*PAR: Some of the homework that she have is the EOG packages.
*HV1: Yes.
*PAR: And I will make my own copy and I would read it and then I would just go ahead and put my
emphasis down, and sometimes to make sure that I knew if she read it, I would try to mark at least two
of the answers wrong and have her to show me if that’s the right answer or not, and she’d just mark an
answer I knew that don’t make sense. I’ll say, “Well, did you read it?” She’ll be like, “Yeah, I did.” Like,
no, you didn’t.
*HV1: That’s pretty good. That’s tricky. I’m gonna have to use that as my daughter gets older. I like
that. That’s very nice. Okay, so you’ll do the EOG passages and she’ll have to correct your mistakes.
*PAR: Yeah.
*HV1: I like that. Is there anything else that you do to help her become –
*PAR: The lady at our church normally gives them a Bible verse to read in the Bible, and I bought them
their own Bible, so it’s based on their age and it’s worded differently from ours, so I would have her read
hers out of her Bible and then she’ll read it out of mine so she could see it’s saying the same thing but
it’s just different. It’s worded different. If I have her to read out of mine first, she’ll be like, “Okay, I
don’t understand this.” I’m like, “Okay. Read it out of yours.”
*HV1: Yeah.

*PAR: And then she’ll understand it a little bit different.
*HV1: Wow. I like that, so kind of making it a little bit easier first, but then showing her the harder
passage after that.
*PAR: Yeah.
*HV1: That’s fantastic. I love that. Very nice, so what do you do when Child P is having a hard time
with a book or with a Bible passage? You mentioned you give her an easier passage. Is there anything
else you do?
*PAR: I just let her take a 10 or 15 minute break, just kind of regroup her stuff and just try to tell her to
go back in there and read it over again and if she don’t understand it, then I’ll explain it to her in the
best way that I can (background conversations).
*HV1: So what are some questions that you ask Child P when you talk about books that she’s read?
*PAR: What’s the main idea? What does she think the story is actually about, the characters. What
took place? What does she think is gonna happen? Does she feel like it could’ve ended another way?
*HV1: That’s nice. Those are excellent questions. I love that, so what, if anything, do you do to make
her want to read more, to make Child P want to read more?
*PAR: Try to let her see me reading. Yeah.
*HV1: That’s wonderful, so are there other people in the home that Child P reads with or that help you
read with her?
*PAR: Sometimes her and Child V will read together, but they’ll have a hard time deciding on what
books they want to read, because Child V might wanna read this and Child P might wanna read another
kind of book.
*HV1: Yeah. That’s the sibling rivalry. It’s hard sometimes. How do you know if Child P has done a
good job when she’s reading a book? Is there anything that you pay attention to?
*PAR: I pay attention to how she’s reading, if she’s able to understand what she’s reading.
*HV1: Yeah, so tell me more about the how she’s reading. What does she do when she’s reading in a
way that makes you think she’s understanding?
*PAR: If she’s dragging what she’s reading, then she’s probably not really showing any interest in it,
but if she’s got a certain speed to it, then I ‘ll know, and I might stop her and ask her what a certain word
means or does she understand what that word means. She might like, “Tommy and Michael wanted to
play ball (reads exasperatedly and sighs).”
*HV1: The sigh and the little –
(Laughter)
*PAR: Yeah.
*HV1: Come on.

*PAR: Are you really reading this? She’s like, “Yeah, I’m reading out loud.”
*HV1: Yeah.
*PAR: I’m like, “Okay.”
*HV1: Very good. Okay, so thank you so much for talking with me today. This has been really
informative, so I hope ______. I’ve learned a lot, so thank you very much.
*PAR: You’re welcome.

*other excerpts from home visit*
*PAR: I think what she’ll do, she’ll kind of skim through it, and if it catches her eye, then she’ll read it,
and I think that she kind of got that from me, because when I’ll look at a book, she’s like, “Mom, why do
you read the back of the book before you read the front?” I’m like, “Because sometimes you can get a
general idea of what the story is gonna be like because they have a little dialogue in the back or it’ll have
a preview of another book that was made before that one, kind of like an introduction to a chapter two
book.”
*HV1: Yeah.
*PAR: I said, “So you can actually get kind of the main idea in the back of the book.” She said, “Oh, I’m
gonna try that.” I said, “Well, that’s for bigger books, when you get older. Kid books don’t have that,”
but if it catches her eye, then she’ll probably –
*HV1: Then she’ll like it.
**
*PAR: I know that there’s information in reading. That you might read something and be like, “Wow. I
didn’t know that.” There’s always information in reading.


01-BCL

*HV1: Okay so we’re interested in knowing the kinds of things you and your third grader do in your
everyday routine, so tell me about a typical day for Child C from morning to bed time as well as you can
remember.

*PAR: Well, typical daily routines, especially during school days, we’re up about 7:20 AM, get ready,
we’re out by 8, at school 8:30, out of school come home, do homework, and then usually after the
homework he’s mainly outside playing, and I’m cooking dinner. So our weekend is really our time to
spend together or do activities together.

*HV1: Okay, so we’re interested in learning more about your child’s books and reading interests. Child
C is in there showing (home visitor) some books, where did you get most of his books from? So would it
be from the school library, public library, did you buy them, did someone else give them to him, or did
the school give them to him? And we’re - like most of them.

*PAR: Most of the collection that they have I’ve actually bought as far as like when they were little.
Like they’ve got a lot of Dr. Seuss books that I’ve ordered in, or Disney books, things like that.

*HV1: Okay, and what are some things that you do to help your child become a good reader?

*PAR: Um, I don’t have the patience with him, I’ve tried to come up with things, I’ve tried to give books
that night interest him and it could take us thirty minutes just to go through two pages, he is, he’s very
_______ when it comes to _______.

*HV1: So, trying to buy books that he likes.

*PAR: Yeah, I’ve tried to, just to interest him but -

*HV1: Right, so what if anything do you do when your child has a hard time with the book?

*PAR: I normally end up reading it to him.

*HV1: Okay, and what are some questions that you ask your child when you talk about books that he
has read?

*PAR: ______________ did you like he book that your read? No. What was in it? I don’t know.

*HV1: Pretty straightforward.

*PAR: Yeah.

*HV1: And what if anything do you do to motivate your child to read?

*PAR: I’ll try to take video games from him, you know, I’ve tried to pretty much take things that he
likes to do away in order for him to read. I can’t help that he ____.

***other excerpts from home visit*
*HV1: And how often do you buy Child C books?
*PAR: Usually the school, the school book fair is when I’ll buy, I’ll take him and I’ll buy them at least two
books.

*HV1: Wonderful. Thank you so much, so we’re done with the survey portion and now I’m gonna ask
you a few questions just related to Child M’s daily schedule and just to get an idea of where she’s
getting some of her books. You told me some of those things already, and then just ways that you’re
supporting her as she reads. The first thing is can you just give me a description of Child M’s daily

a very big vocabulary and she ____ ____ just read right through and she ____ ____ ______ slow down
so I can read too.
*HV1: Excellent, so earlier you mentioned you ask her some questions after she reads or while she

Well, the answer was because they’re itchy and she said, “Because ____ ______.” I said, “No.” I said,
“You’re not sure.” I said, “Okay, read the story again.”
She read it again and I said, “Okay, in this ____ ____ it was happy,” but she goes, “Grandmomma, it said

It’s because when they got wet, they got itchy. We go through that a lot. She says, “Well, I think it’s
that. Okay, if I get it wrong, I’m gonna tell my teacher you told me to put this answer.” I said, “Okay, I’m
gonna call your teacher and ask for the answer, because I think this is the answer.”
*HV1: Yeah.
*PAR: Well, we go through that a lot.
*HV2: That’s good. She analyzes.
*PAR: Huh?
*HV2: I said that’s good. She analyzes.
*PAR: Yeah, real bad.

*HV1: Yeah. Great. Wonderful. So we’re done with this kind of survey questions. And now we’re just
interested in learning a little bit about like Child D’s schedule. Like what does he day look like from
when he wakes up till when he goes to bed?

*PAR: When he get up in the morning he dump the trash, get ready for school. When he get home in
the evening he do his homework and he go out and play. Come back in, take his bath and go to bed.

*HV1: Is there anything in particular he likes to play in the afternoons?

*PAR: Basketball.

*HV1: Okay. Very nice. So we’re interested in learning about Child D’s just reading interests and the
books that he likes. We’re trying to get an idea – where would you say Child D gets most of his books
from? You mentioned he goes to the library about once a week.

*PAR: Yeah. And then my mom, she gives us a lot of books. She buys a lot books from the dollar store.

*HV1: Great. So what, if anything, what are some things that you do to help Child D become a good
reader? Are there any –

*PAR: Read with him.

*HV1: Can you tell me more what that looks like?

*PAR: What you mean?

*HV1: Like do you guys sit on the couch and –

*PAR: Yeah, or on the floor. We just read.

*HV1: Nice.

*PAR: Excuse me. Let me turn this pot down.

*HV1: Sure. We just have a couple more questions.

*PAR: Okay.

*HV1: So thank you. So what do you do when Child D has a hard time with a book?

*PAR: Like I said, I sit down and read with him, try to help him understand.

*HV1: Are there any questions you ask him when he’s read a book or?

*PAR: Yeah. I ask him about just did he understand what he read and what the characters was and
stuff like that.

*HV1: Great.

*PAR: Sometime he answers, sometime he don’t. I don’t know, Mom.

*HV1: Yeah. So is there anything that you’ve found really gets him excited about reading or helps
motivate him to read?

*PAR: If it’s a lot of action going on in the book. He loves that.

*HV1: Okay. Nice. Wonderful. Perfect. Thank you so much. These have been so helpful.

*PAR: I keep this?

*HV1: Yeah. You can keep that if you want. Hopefully we’ll get some good books sent over to Child D
this summer. Are you excited about getting these books in the mail? Nice.

*PAR: So he can tell his sister, this my book. These are mine. That’s the first thing he’ll say.

*HV1: You can put your name in it.

*PAR: They all competitive against each other.

*HV1: I remember that. Sibling.

*PAR: Very competitive.
*other coded excerpts from home visit*
*PAR: I like to sit down and help him with his homework. I didn’t graduate from high school but I help
him as much as I can. And if I can’t help him, I try to find somebody that can help him, you know. I like
to go to his games and stuff. We watch movies all the time.


01-AMO
*HV1: Okay. Okay, now we’re gonna go into the other part, just some open ended questions. We’re
interested in knowing the kinds of things you and Child D do in your everyday routines. Tell me about a
typical day for Child D from morning to bedtime as well as you can remember.
*PAR: He gets up in the morning. He usually fix himself breakfast.
*HV1: Okay.
*PAR: Because that’s what he likes to do to show that he’s big. We’ll go. I’m involved with church a
lot, so maybe I’ll have something to do with church or maybe he’ll have something to do, like choir
practice or choir practice for me, go to the grocery store. It’s starting to get summer, so lately we’ve
been _____ shorts and stuff. I go to work. I go to work in the evening time. He’s with his sisters or he’ll
go to my sister’s house and they come home. He’ll read. I call. He get his stuff out for school and go to
bed.
*HV1: Sounds good. We’re interested in learning more about your child’s books and interests and
reading interests, so right now Child D is showing (home visitor) some books. Where did you get most of
his books from?
*PAR: When I have the book fair at school, every now and again we may go to the bookstore and he’ll
ask for something. Most of the time it’s book fairs and when he was – I’ve been here for four years. We
was in South Carolina. He was in a book program, and they would send him a book once a month, so
that’s where he got a lot of his books from.
*HV1: Okay, so would you say that he got them from the school library, public library, or did you buy
them for him? Did someone else give him books or did the school give him books, so as far as most of
his books.
*PAR: It’s pretty much most of his books, they were given to him.
*HV1: Okay. What are some things that you do to help Child D become a good reader?
*PAR: Make sure he reads often.
*HV1: Okay.
*PAR: Go back over if he misses something, to reread the sentence. We just found out recently – I
found out recently while I had him reading one night that he got to where he didn’t really wanna read.
He would read a little bit and he would say, “I’ll do it later,” and come to find out he needed glasses.
That’s why he didn’t.
*HV1: Oh, okay.
*PAR: So instead of saying, “I can’t see,” or, “My eyes hurt,” or something, he would just make
excuses, so he got glasses, and he’s all right again.
*HV1: All right. That’s good. Good, so what, if anything, do you do when Child D has a hard time with
a book?

*PAR: We just go over it, continue to go over it, repetition. That’s what I always learned, repetition is
the best teaching.
*HV1: Okay and what are some questions that you ask Child D when you talk about books that he
reads.
*PAR: What’s the author, the illustrator? What was the beginning of the book about, the middle, and
the end, or I ask, “So what do you think’s gonna happen next?”
*HV1: Okay.
*PAR: Did you like the book or what is it about the book that you like?
*HV1: Sounds good. What, if anything, do you do to motivate Child D to read?
*PAR: When he asks about books, I make sure I’m able to get him, or I let him know that I’ll get the
book, or we’ll try to get the book or something like that, and then I’ll just ask and remind him every day,
“Did you read? How many pages did you read? Did you know all the words,” or if he’s got a problem
with a word, like I said, I’m at work. I tell him to spell the word out and we’ll try to pronounce, and he’s
real good at breaking it down, getting it.
*HV1: Okay. Very good, so are there other people in your home that help Child D with reading?
*PAR: No. They’re teenagers, so they’ve got their own life.
*HV1: Oh (laughter), okay.
*PAR: They’ll say, “Did you do your homework,” or something like that, but as far as sitting down, they
won’t do it.
*HV1: Okay, all right. How do you know if Child D has done a good job reading a book?
*PAR: Listening to him.
*HV1: Listening to him? Okay. What makes a good third grade reader?
*PAR: Just doing it all the time, doing it all the time and having support, being there with them, letting
them read to you.
*HV1: Okay, all right, and what should a good reader be able to do?
*PAR: I think they should be able to tell you about what they read, read fluently, learn how to break
the words down and understanding what they mean.
*HV1: Okay, how would you describe Child D’s reading skills?
*PAR: I think he’s doing pretty good for his age.
*HV1: Okay, so as far as some of the things that you described as far as what should a good reader be
able to do, like what do you think as far as his skills do you think he falls within some of those things?
*PAR: Yeah. He does.
*HV1: Okay.

*PAR: There’s times where he wanna do something else, so his mind will go somewhere else, but as
long as I encourage them or they’re with them, he does good.
*HV1: Okay. All right, so what goals do you have for Child D’s reading this summer?
*PAR: To make sure he reads like he did during the year and don’t get thrown off, because most of the
time, if they don’t read during the summer or continue doing some of the things they did during the
school year, they’ll forget, and so they have to catch back up that following year or whatever, so just try
to make sure he read and do a little work and stuff during the summer.
*HV1: Okay. Sounds good, so I think that we just need to wait for them to finish up, but –
*PAR: I can’t think of the name of that ______ The Diary of a Wimpy Kid.
*HV1: Diary of a Wimpy Kid?
*PAR: Yeah.
*HV1: Okay.
*PAR: So he love those.
*HV1: Yeah. Most third graders like that series.
*PAR: He get those. He have surprised me with some of the books he got like the Guinness Book of
World Records, just tell about different little facts and stuff, so he got two different kinds of those books
from the library. ____ _____ go to the library ____ ______.
*HV1: Okay, at school?
*PAR: ____ _____ _____.
*HV1: Okay. Yeah, a lot of kids his age are interested in the Guinness Book, those types of books that
give a lot of facts and real neat stuff. She’ll be finished in a minute (background conversations). He has
such a bright smile.
*PAR: Mm-hmm (laughs).
*HV1: Are you enjoying your Saturday?
*PAR: Well, yeah. I’ve been sick the past couple of days, but just being off, and this is the first day I’ve
been moving around and stuff.
*HV1: Oh, okay.
*PAR: I’m enjoying it. I like being home and _______ with him.
*HV1: Yeah.
*PAR: Excuse me. I can’t come. You better read.
*HV1: So did he enjoy third grade this year?

*PAR: Yes and no. He’s had some problems with his teacher, and I don’t really – I don't know, so I’m
thinking about maybe changing his school. I was thinking I’ll change his school next year.
*HV1: Oh, okay.
*PAR: He didn’t have a good experience with his teacher.
*HV1: Okay. Now the school that goes to is a traditional calendar?
*PAR: Mm-hmm.
*HV1: Yeah, a traditional? Okay, so there will be other schools.
*PAR: Yeah.
*HV1: Do you have another school in this district that he can go to?
*PAR: Well, it’s not traditional, so I think I may have waited too late for that, but if he could go to
another traditional school, even if I have to drive, I think I’m gonna do it next year because I was really
disappointed this year.
*HV1: Okay.


01-ASR
*HV1: Alright. So we’re interested in knowing the kinds of things you and your third grader do in your
everyday routine. So tell me about a typical day for Child A, from morning to bedtime, as well as you
can remember.

*PAR: Okay. She wakes up, and we get her dressed. She’ll eat a little bit of breakfast before she goes
to school – and eats more breakfast. She comes home from school, does her homework, takes a bath,
makes sure her room is straightened and clean, eats dinner. And then she goes to bed.

She’s supposed to spend 30 minutes reading each night before she goes to bed. So like I said, she does
that maybe three to four times out of the week. Other than that, sometimes it’s so late, by the time she
gets done doing her daily activities, she doesn’t get a chance.

*HV1: Okay. We’re interested in learning more about your child’s books and reading interests. So
right now, she’s in there showing (HOME VISITOR) some books.

Where did your child get most of her books from? So from the school library? Public library? Did you
buy them? Did someone else give them to her? Or did the school give them to her?

*PAR: I bought them, and people have given us –

*HV1: Okay. But for most of them, would you say –?

*PAR: I bought 'em. Uh-huh.

*HV1: And what are some things that you do to help your child become a good reader?

*PAR: Well, when we had more time, before the other ones came along, we used to read every day,
hours at a time, non-stop. And she really liked reading more when she was little than she does now. I’ll
help her sound out words, if she has problems with reading books. Or she’ll act out parts of the story.

So I just like her to – kind of make sure she’s getting the concept of the book.

*HV1: Right. Right. Okay. So what, if anything, do you do when your child has a hard time with a
book?

*PAR: As far as reading it? The words and stuff?

*HV1: Uh-huh.

*PAR: I’ll help her to sound out the words. Or if she asks what something means, then I’ll tell her what
that word means.

*HV1: Okay. And what are some questions that you ask your child when you talk about books that she
has read?

*PAR: Who was the main character? What was the part that she liked the most? That’s about it. She
usually tells me most everything. She’s at that age where she talks more and asks a lot of questions
about different things. So.

*HV1: Right. So what, if anything, do you to do motivate her to read?

*PAR: I do tell her to read. Every day, I tell her to read. But that’s about it. Just making sure that she
does take the time out to read.

*HV1: Okay. And are there other people in your home that help your child with reading?

*PAR: No.

*HV1: How do you know if your child has done a good job reading a book?

*PAR: How do I know if she’s done a good job? She knows the whole story. She’s read the book, from
the beginning to the end.

*HV1: Okay. And what makes a good third grade reader? And what should a good reader be able to
do?

*PAR: What makes a good third grade reader?

*HV1: Uh-huh. And what should a good reader be able to do?

*PAR: Of course, if they’re reading at their level of material, they should be able to read the book,
from the beginning to the end, without help. And I think they should be able to grasp the concept of it –
know what the story is about and be able to tell someone else what that story is about.

*HV1: Okay. And how would you describe your child’s reading skills?

*PAR: I think they’re good.

*HV1: Okay. What goals do you have for your child’s reading this summer?

*PAR: That she’ll continue to read every day, and that she’ll become a stronger reader.

*HV1: Well, that’s it. So those are all the parent questions. Now we’re just gonna wait for them. They
should be finished in a few minutes.

*PAR: Oh, okay.

*


01-AZC

*HV1: B. Okay, great. So those are about a third of my questions for you, and I can take that off your
hands. So the questions that I have left are all open-ended. Let me just scoot a little closer to you.
Okay. Okay. So we are interested in learning about the kinds of things that you and Child L do in your
everyday routine. So if you were to think about a typical day for Child L from the time she wakes up in
the morning to the time she goes to bed, can you kind of walk me through what her day looks like?

*PAR: She get up, and she be up before I do sometimes, and she’ll play around the house. She’ll do
something, do – play with her nail stuff. When she _________ she playing teacher all the time. And
then she’ll eat breakfast and then she’ll get a shower. She’ll get on her clothes, and if it’s too hot
_____________ she’ll go in her room and play. And then she’ll – if we ain’t got nowhere to go that day,
to the park or nothing, then she’ll go down to her friend’s ___________ and play, stay down there until
about 8:00 and then she’ll come _______.

*HV1: 8:00 at night?

*PAR: Mm-hmm.

*HV1: Okay.

*PAR: And then she’ll come back in.

*HV1: And what happens after that?

*PAR: We eat, and then she might read or sit down on the floor, put her blanket down and read some
books or write or something like that.

*HV1: Okay.

*PAR: ___________ some ________.

*HV1: Say that again?

*PAR: Crossword puzzle books. I’m gonna get me and her one.

*HV1: Okay, yeah. That sounds fun.

*PAR: Yeah. I’ll get me one and her one, ________ I got mine and she’ll go try to write in it and, you
know, do it, solve the puzzle. I’ll be like, “That’s for me,” so I’m gonna get her one.

*HV1: And then after the crossword puzzles what happens?

*PAR: She _______ TV and then she’ll go to bed.

*HV1: Okay. About what time does she go to bed?

*PAR: Sometimes 11:00

*HV1: Okay.

*PAR: But on schools nights she’ll _______ bed at 9:00.

*HV1: Okay. Can you tell me what a school day looks like for her, or does it kind of look the same?

*PAR: Yeah, she’ll get up in the morning, she’ll go to school, she’ll come home, she’ll do her homework
before she can go outside. Then she’ll read for ten minutes, then she gets to go outside.

*HV1: Okay, got it.

*PAR: __________ school.

*HV1: Thank you. And we’re interested in learning more about her books and her reading interests,
and she’s showing (Home Visitor) one of her favorite books right now. Our question for you is, where
have you gotten most of her books from?

*PAR: I get at __________ place. I can’t afford ________. I can’t afford to buy no brand-new ______
they real cheap. But I’ll go around – like if I go to the mission, or they had these – you know, they had
this stuff out, say if they have a thing ____________ or at a church or something, I always try to pick her
up some books –

*HV1: Kind of like a book sale or –

*PAR: ______________

*HV1: Oh, like a free book fair. Okay.

*PAR: Yeah, _________ get her books like that. And she got a library card, so –

*HV1: Great. A public library card?

*PAR: Yeah, yeah, so ___________ stuff from the library. Her mom will come and get her and take her
to the library, and she got some stuff at the library.

*HV1: Okay. Is that how she got to be so gifted, from all that reading?

*PAR: Yeah, yes. She __________ read. She can read.

*HV1: Wow.

*PAR: Yeah, she __________.

*HV1: All right. My next question for you, what if anything do you do when she’s having a hard time
with a book?

*PAR: I’ll try to help her read it, but usually she don’t be having no hard time, ‘cause when she was –
they say she was above her grade reading. _________ like, “Child L, this book hard,” and she like, “Nah,
this is easy.”

*HV1: Wow. So it sounds like she doesn’t need help all that often.

*PAR: Uh-uh. No, no.

*HV1: Okay. And what are some questions that you ask her when you talk to her about books that
she’s read?

*PAR: I ask her was the book hard or easy, ‘cause one time she had a book and I said, “This book – I
know this book is too easy. Let’s get a hard book.”

*HV1: Mm-hmm. So you’ll ask her was it easy or hard?

*PAR: Yeah. And I looked and I said, “This book is too easy for you.” I try to give her books ________
she read it.

*HV1: Mm-hmm. Great, that’s a great question. Any other questions you ask her, or is that about it?

*PAR: That’s about it.

*HV1: Great, okay. And what if anything do you do to motivate her to read?

*PAR: Well, I sometimes ______ buy a bag __________ come home, sit down and read this book –

*HV1: A bag of what?

*PAR: ________. It’s some potato chips we love.

*HV1: Oh, okay – potato chips.

*PAR: Yeah, something she loves. And I’ll be like, “C’mon, Child L.” I’ll be like, “_______ read these
books _____________.”

*HV1: Okay. So potato chips are a motivator.

*PAR: Yeah.

*HV1: Okay. And are there other people in the home that help her with reading?

*PAR: Uh-uh, just my son. Sometimes she don’t understand something, I don’t understand, I’ll wait for
him to come home –

*HV1: Okay, so sometimes he’ll help.

*PAR: Yeah.

*HV1: And how old is your son?

*PAR: Twenty.

*HV1: Okay. And what does your son do to help when she needs it?

*PAR: He’ll explain it to her, and she’ll – but most of the time she _ _______ how to read things.

*HV1: Yeah, it sounds like she just needs very little help.

*PAR: Yeah, she know how to read.

*HV1: Okay. And how do you know that Child L has done a good job of reading a book?

*PAR: Because she’ll come and she’ll tell me like, “Grandma, I already know how to read this book,”
and I’ll be like, “Let me see. Read it to me.” And she’ll read the book to me, and I’ll be looking at it
______. That’s how _______.

*HV1: That’s great. Okay. And in your opinion what makes a good third-grade reader? What should
they be able to do?

*PAR: Read on the third grade level, not above, and you got to _____ practice, practice, practice, and
make them read.

*HV1: Okay, great. And my last question for you, what are your goals for Child L’s reading over the
summertime?

*PAR: I want her to ___________ go down to the library, I’m gonna tell her, “Pick out” – she gonna
read them paperback books, so I’m gonna try to get some of them.

*HV1: And when you say paperback, do you mean like chapter books?

*PAR: Yeah. She can read – one time they gave her one and she read it, and she read the book all in
one day. I’m like, “Save some for tomorrow, Child L!” She’ll read it all in one day.

*HV1: Do you call her Child L for short? Yeah.

*PAR: Yeah, I call her Child L.

*HV1: I’ve never heard the name Child L. That’s nice. And how long have you been taking care of her?

*PAR: I’ve had her since she was two.

*HV1: Okay, okay. So I interrupted you – I’m sorry. What goals do you have for her summer reading?

*PAR: ______ read more, and I’m gonna let her be reading over the summer so when she go back to

gonna go down there, ________ library after 2:00 and then we’ll come back.

*HV1: Fortunately it’s not too far, I mean by bus – yeah.

*PAR: Yeah, we’ll take the bus ________________.

*HV1: Good. Well, those were all my questions for you. You’ve been really helpful. Thanks for
answering them. And the child portion always takes a little bit longer than the parent portion, so we’ve
got a little extra time. So we can use this time to get your gift card done.


01-ATD
*HV1: And chat with you all. Yes. Okay. So next question. We are interested in knowing the kinds of
things that you and Child J do just in your every day routine. So I’m just gonna ask you to tell me about a
typical day for Child J from morning to bedtime, as well as you can remember.

*PAR: Okay. Child J wakes up in the morning probably about maybe like 10:00 on the weekend – you
mean during the week or on the weekends?

*HV1: Just average schedule.

*PAR: He gets up and brush his teeth, wash his face. If he’s going to school he’ll get his clothes on and
go head on to school. But just on the weekend what it is is he get up, I’ll fix him breakfast. He’ll watch
TV. We’ll watch something together. We’ll go to the park. And just depends. It just depends on how
we’re feeling that day or what we’re gonna do. We have plans we’ll go ahead and do what we got to do
and then we’ll come on back home. Usually I do it – we’ll be gone, everybody get tired, come back here
and take a bath and get them to bed. They still have a set bedtime during the week. About 8:30. Still.
Which is weird. But you know have to have my break too. You know.

*HV1: That’s not weird at all.

*PAR: So I have to have me some me time.

*HV1: Absolutely.

*PAR: So they go to bed about 8:30. That’s about pretty much a typical day. He plays. Enjoys hisself
like a normal child. Sometimes I’m with him and sometimes I’m in my room and sometimes I’m not.
They loud. So sometime I’m around, sometime I’m not.

*HV1: Okay. Okay. And what might Child J’s routine be once he gets home from school?

*PAR: Oh, he comes home. He eats. That’s the first thing he want to do is eat and drink. He eats.
Then he’ll do his homework. Then he’ll watch TV. Then we’ll make sure he gets his clothes out. He goes
to take his bath and he’ll go to bed.

*HV1: Got it. Okay. Thank you.

*PAR: Mm hmm.

*HV1: All right. So one of the things that this study’s really interested in is learning more about Child
J’s books and what his reading interests are. So I know that right now Child J is showing Margaret some
of the books that he is reading. And what I’m wondering is where did he get most of his books from?

*PAR: Well, since I have five kids, my mom, she keeps everything. So like from the time I started
having kids, like, you know you do the baby love and then __ and the school. You get the – like if you do
good or your birthday at school they might give you some pencils or some books. We just keep
everything. We accumulated so many. Like over the years. Just keeping them from each kid. Like most
of them honestly we can say we got from the doctors. When you go get your immunization shots and
stuff like that. And they usually go on from age group. Like when they even get shots now they give
them books. So it’s just over the years we’ve just accumulated them over time. From my other kids and
everything.

*HV1: Great.

*PAR: They have a large book collection.

*HV1: Who does?

*PAR: The kids. All the kids.

*HV1: Oh, the kids do. Yeah. Well, I imagine yeah, over, across five kids you do accumulate a lot.

*PAR: Yeah. I accumulated a lot of books.

*HV1: That’s a very helpful answer. Thank you. Where are the kids getting their books. So. Okay.
Next question, what are some things that you do to help Child J become a good reader?

*PAR: I read with Child J. I help him sound out his words. And I have little funny ways. I don’t learn
like everybody else. So all my little ways and my little tricks, I try to show him. Because I see his
learning, - I don’t think he has a learning disability like me. But I do see a lot of traits, things that I
struggle with I see it in him. So I try to show him all my little things to help me get by. Whether it be the
weird ways I sound out stuff or sometimes if I don’t know how to spell it I might write it out. I have to
write it and see what it looks like and change it around. Like all my little tricks that I know for myself, I
try to show him so he can get it too. Cause one thing, you know different things work for different
people.

*HV1: Absolutely.

*PAR: So I definitely – he shows me how he works things out and it’s neat. And I say, “Oh, I’m gonna
try that.” And I show him. So I learn as well with him.

*HV1: It sounds like you’re able to draw a lot on your own experience and what has worked for you.

*PAR: Mm hmm. That’s right. Mm hmm. Over the years. That’s right.

*HV1: That’s great. I didn’t mean to cut you off. Was there anything else you wanted to share?

*PAR: No, that’s fine.

*HV1: Okay. So next question, what, if anything, do you do when you see Child J having a hard time
with a book?

*PAR: Child J gets frustrated very easily. And he will go off. Like he have these fits, like tantrums. So
one thing that I notice that I have to do with Child J, if something frustrates him, it's better for him just
to walk away for a little while. And then come back to it later. Even after his mind is relaxed and is not
thinking about it so hard anymore. Because Child J gets frustrated very easily. And when he gets
frustrated he’s like me. He gets discouraged. So when I see that, I don’t want him to get so discouraged
that he don’t want to go back to it. So I will tell him, okay, let’s take a break. Just go ahead and take a
break. Watch cartoons for a little while. Go get you a snack or something like that. That’s one thing I
do that helps him a lot.

*HV1: Okay.

*PAR: That brings him back down, you know.

*HV1: Yeah.

*PAR: From his fits. Cause Child J will have a fit. He will.

*HV1: Okay. That’s a great strategy.

*PAR: He’s very strong willed. Very. How he feels is how he feels. And nothing is gonna change that,
you know. So we’re just gonna have to make things better. Hey, we’re gonna take a break, okay?
Cause we both getting frustrated. So let’s go take a break and we gonna come back to it in a little while.
But that’s basically what I do. That’s one of my strategies.

*HV1: Sounds like a good idea.

*PAR: Mm hmm.

*HV1: Any other strategies or?

*PAR: No. I think that’s pretty much it. I think that’s – when he gets frustrated. We just do that.

*HV1: Got it.

*PAR: Or we might pray about it. If it’s really, really stressing us we might pray about it.

*HV1: [Inaudible Comment]

*PAR: Yeah, we’ll pray about it. If we don’t have the understanding. Cause sometime I don’t have the
understanding all the way as well. So we’ll pray about it and see where that get us.

*HV1: And you’re talking in this particular instance about the book.

*PAR: Mm hmm. Yeah. About a book. If he’s not understanding, I’m trying to explain to him what
they’re saying or anything. You know he gets frustrated, we’ll do that.

*HV1: Okay. Yeah. Well, thank you for sharing that with me. So what are some questions that you ask
Child J when you talk about books that he has read?

*PAR: I make sure I ask him does he understand. Do you understand what I’m saying? Do you
understand what he did? Do you understand what happens first, what comes first? Do you understand
what comes last? What’d they do in the middle? You know just things like that. Did he enjoy it? And
whether it’s something that he would like to read again. Or would he put in his favorite book category.
Things like that.

*HV1: Got it. Okay. And what, if anything, do you do to motivate Child J to read?

*PAR: I try to explain to him that reading is – it takes you to another place. That you can have kind of
like peace of mind. If you get you a good book and you really enjoy it, then you can take yourself out of
there. Like you’ll be into it and you’ll also be learning and exploring and having fun all at the same time.
So when he say he doesn’t want to read, I really tell him that it’s important that he does read. And he
finds something that he enjoys. Because reading is very fundamental. You know you just can’t tell them
that. But, you know. But that’s basically what I’m telling is how it’s helping him and how it’s gonna help
him, how reading helps him and throughout life. Not just you just right then reading. But it helps you
with everything. You’ll be a better reader, a better writer, a better math, person that does math. We
just be better – if you _____ _____ get understanding.

*HV1: Mm hmm. Great. Thank you. Let’s see. Okay. So are there other people in the home that help
Child J with reading? And I know you had mentioned your 14 year old daughter. And anyone else you
might like to mention. So are there other people in the home that help him with reading? And what do
they do to help?

*PAR: They read with him.

*HV1: And who’s they?

*PAR: My son Child JJ. My son Child JJ, he’s 11 and Child J is 10. My son Child JJ, he’s like honor roll
student. So he really –

*HV1: Oh, wow.

*PAR: Yeah. He’s been on the honor roll ever since he started school. So he always helps them and
see if he’s getting the understand of it. He see if he does something wrong. He really works with him.
He loves Child J. He really does. Like they really close. They fuss a lot, but they’re close too.

*HV1: Yeah.

*PAR: See he makes sure he has understanding. If he got it wrong, if he hears him saying something
wrong or pronouncing something wrong, he’ll tell him. He’ll stop him and he’ll tell him, this is how you
say it. You sound it out like this. This is ___ or this is not, you know. Like that. And my little girl and my
mom, she helps.

*HV1: Okay. And your little girl is the 14 year old?

*PAR: Mm hmm.

*HV1: Okay. And what does she – does she have anything that she does with Child J?

*PAR: She reads with him. She’s a little bossy with it cause she’s playing school.

*HV1: It’s more about the teacher role than the actual reading.

*PAR: It is. You’re right. You’re right. But he does get out – if they enjoy listening to her. So I don’t
really hear her doing a lot of – I don’t know. If they say something wrong, he’s pronounced something
wrong or said something wrong, she’ll help him. Or if she see him struggling with a word she’ll help him.

*HV1: Okay.

*PAR: But other than that she’s just reading and bossing.

*HV1: Okay. Memories. I was that teacher with my little brother.

*PAR: Really?

*HV1: And then did you mention your mom? His grandma.

*PAR: Ah huh.

*HV1: Okay. And so grandma’s involved. Is there anything she does to help that you’ve noticed?

*PAR: Well, she’s a teacher. So she does it strongly. Like she does – like my son, my baby boy, he was
having some issues in school. So she’s tutoring him. He has gotten so much better. She tutors him
every day.

*HV1: And when you say your baby are you talking about Child J?

*PAR: Nm mm. I have a son younger than him. But she also helps Child J as well. Them two she help.
She tutors them. She’ll do it together sometimes. So she really takes a lot of time out with them.

*HV1: What a blessing.

*PAR: Mm hmm. It is.

*HV1: That’s great.

*PAR: It really is. She works with them a lot. Like a whole lot. Like I supposed to. She said, “What you
gonna do with you move and I’m not around?”

*HV1: And does she live in the home?

*PAR: Mm hmm. This is actually her house. Yes. We just in transition of moving.

*HV1: Okay. That’s why you said that. Got it. Okay. And how do you know if Child J has done a good
job reading a book?

*PAR: He’s very excited. He’s very excited. He wants to show me everything that he has done and
read it over. Show me every word and how he sounded it out. He’s good with showing you what he’s
done and how he did it. So he’s good with that. So that’s like I said, we both show each other skills. He
shows me how he does stuff and it help me sometimes. So he’s really excited. He lets you know how
he’s done and all of that.

*HV1: So you can just kind of tell by his emotional state.

*PAR: Mm hmm. Yeah. He’s very excited.

*HV1: Yeah. So what do you think makes a good third grade reader? And what should a good reader
be able to do?

*PAR: I think what makes a good third grade reader is just to keep trying. The effort, you have to put
forth that effort. You just can’t give up. And what’d you say again?

*HV1: I know, it’s a double question. What makes a good third grade reader? What should a good
reader be able to do?

*PAR: I feel like a good reader should be able to sound out words. And always ask for help. A good
reader will always ask for help and sound things out. Know all this little tricks of the trade I should say to
get better and be open minded. For sure. You definitely have to be open minded and not want to give
up. So.

*HV1: Thank you. And how would you describe Child J’s reading skills?

*PAR: Child J, he can read. He came a long way. He’s doing a lot better than what he was. But he still
has a ways to go. Like I said, he’s like me. Little learning issues. We catch on a little slow and then if we
don’t use it we lose it. So he also needs to utilize it on a daily basis so he’ll still like – that’s why like
summer time it’s good. He needs to be kind of like in an academic camp. Because he needs to use it or
he’ll loose it. It’ll be kind of like he’ll be – it’ll be new to him when the year starts. You see what I'm
saying? And he’ll be kind of lost.

*HV1: I do. I do.

*PAR: So. Child J just needs to practice. Practice, practice, practice is all I can say. Just practice. He
can get better. He can. But he struggles like me.

*HV1: Okay. Well, our study is going to give him the books to practice.

*PAR: Okay.

*HV1: And this is my final question for you. What goals do you have for Child J’s reading this summer?

*PAR: For him to be better. At least to make three more notches above – if he’s at a reading level of
10, I want him to be at 13. You know what I’m saying? Like I want him to get better as long as I see the
progress, as long as I see him getting better I’m okay with that. You see what I’m saying?

*HV1: Okay.

*PAR: I’m fine with that. As long as he’s getting better and he’s not giving up and he wants to keep
trying. My thing is he’ll get discouraged, if he gets discouraged then that’s it. You know what I’m
saying? We just got to keep that going. Keep that –

*HV1: Well, it sounds. Oh, I’m sorry.

*PAR: No, you okay. Keep that line of communication open. Like Child J has to tell me, I want him to
tell me stress and let me know that. If he’s not enjoying his book, let me know so we can get something
that you do enjoy. So he don’t get bored and not want to do it. That’s my biggest thing. Biggest thing is
just practice and excel.

*HV1: Mm hmm. Well, it sounds like he’s got a good encourager of a mom to help him along.

*PAR: Thank you.

*HV1: So we have completed our work together. Thank you for being so open and helpful.

*PAR: Okay. You’re welcome.


01-AWS
*open-ended*
*HV1: Okay. Okay. And so the second set of questions – we’re interested in knowing the kinds of
things you and your third grader do in your everyday routines. So tell me about a typical day for Child R,
from morning to bedtime, as well as you can remember.

*PAR: Morning – get up around 6:20. Get ready for school. Leave out by 6:45. Go to school – well, go
to my cousin’s house to go to school. Go to school. Get home at 4:00 – normally around 4:00.

Between 4:00 and 4:30, be home with her – 4:30, 5:00, 6:00 – playtime – 6:00, 7:00 – we go to a parttime job and do there. Be back by 7:30. At 9:00, shower. Be ready for bed by 10:00.

*HV1: Okay. And so we’re interested in learning more about your child’s books and reading interests.
So Child R is in there showing (home visitor) some books right now.

Where did you get most of her books from? So would it be the school library? Public library? Did you
buy them? Did someone else give them to her? Or did the school give them to her?

*PAR: I think some, the school had gave to her. And then some – probably overdue books from the
library.

*HV1: So as far as most of 'em, would you say –?

*PAR: I think school, when she left from one school to another. And they give away old books. That’s
where a lot of the stuff came from.

*HV1: Okay. And what are some things you do to help your child become a good reader?

*PAR: She goes on the Internet and works on there – some reading websites. I know last time she did
an assignment, I made her reread it and redo the questions.

[Inaudible]

*HV1: Okay. And what, if anything, do you do when your child has a hard time with a book?

*PAR: We’ll talk about it.

*HV1: Okay.

*PAR: We’ll talk about it.

*HV1: And what are some questions that you ask your child, when you talk about books that she has
read?

*PAR: Main characters. Some of the things that have happened in the book. Let me see. What else?
Events. That’s about the same.

*HV1: Okay. What are some questions that you ask your child when you talk – did I do that already?

*PAR: You did.

[Laughter]

*HV1: Okay. What, if anything, do you do to motivate your child to read? Sorry.

*PAR: I don’t do anything. But I know her father may reward her. I don’t do anything.

*HV1: Okay.

*PAR: I don’t do nothing. What is she doing?

*HV2: She’s reading right now.

*HV1: Okay. Are there other people in your home that help your child with reading?

*PAR: Yes. Help her?

*HV1: Uh-huh.

*PAR: Her sister.

*HV1: Okay. And what kinds of things do they do to help?

*PAR: She’ll stick with her and read with her – and with her assignments and whatnot.

*HV1: Okay. And how do you know if your child has done a good job reading a book?

*PAR: Based on the answers to those questions.

*HV1: Okay.

*HV2: Alright.

*PAR: Okay.

*other excerpts from home visit*
*HV1: Okay. And how often do you guy Child R books? So I guess that would be considered –
*PAR: We don’t buy. We just sit there and read, like it’s a library. Never.


01-AUS
*open-ended interview*

*HV1: Great. Thank you so much. So that's a little survey that's going to get hopefully good books that
____ will be interested in, mailed to you this summer. And then now I have just a few open-ended
questions so we can get a better idea of what Child V's schedule looks like, just the average typical day,
and then what are you doing to support his reading just in every day conversation. So first tell me a
little bit about his daily schedule, his everyday routine from when he wakes up to when he goes to bed.

*PAR:
He gets up, he'll wash up, get dressed, go to school on typical school nights.
When he gets home we'll do homework if he have any. Sometimes I'll let him play before homework.
Then you'll have his -- the way he eats is sort of when he wants to, unless his dad want to have family
night. Sometimes we'll get the family nights visits. On weekends it just depends. We try to get them to
the Y because we have a membership to the Y. When he get up in the morning, go get his haircut every
Saturday, that's a routine, go to the Y or whatever, may go visit the kids, my older kids, my grandkids,
but his one routine every Saturday is the barber shop and the other routine every Sunday and
Wednesday is church. And in church they do a lot of reading, of course, and he knows a lot about the
Bible, he can read a lot. Actually he can read the Bible better than he can some books.

*HV1: Interesting.

*PAR:

Yeah, it is.

*HV1: So we're interested in learning more about the books that Child V has so right now he's showing
(Home Visitor) some of the books he has and he enjoys reading. You mentioned that he gets a lot of his
books handed down from your kids and their kids. Would you say that's where he gets most of his
books from or does he get his books from anywhere else?

*PAR:
Most of them come from there. But I have a daughter that has Downs
syndrome and she loves books. So she'll go in the store and she'll pick up a book. When she's tired of
him she'll pass them on to him.

*HV1: Great. So what are some things that you do to help Child V become a good reader?

*PAR:
I reads to him. I reads to him and I encourage him that it's very important to
read a lot because when he reads a lot it will help him to spell more. So -- and I tells him he has to learn
how to read better because you needs good jobs. If you don't have a good you can't get a good job.
Very few.

*HV1: So what if anything do you do when Child V has a hard time with a book?

*PAR:
I encourage him and I tells him he can do it. I really encourage him and just
supports him. I let him know he can do anything he wants to do. And he does try. If you were seeing
this child about a year ago, and the teacher he has this year, Ms. H, she is so excellent. She have really
motivated him, she have pulled up his self-esteem, she have told him, "Child V you can do it," and I
mean really he feel -- he the type of person he look at people expression and if he can feel it he believe
it. And so he has really come a long way, a lot of work.

*HV1: So what are some questions that you ask Child V when you're talking about books that he's
read?

*PAR:
Do he like it. And I ask him what he read. He's good at remembering what he
reads or what you read to him.

*HV1: So what if anything do you do to motivate Child V to read?

*PAR:
Sometime I have to bribe him, or you can get this or get that. It works. Reading
is not one of his strongest subjects so I have to promise him a little something just to boost him on over.

*HV1: Wonderful. Thank you so much. This was wonderful. This is going to give us a really good idea
of some good books to send his way and thank you once again for sharing all the great stuff you're doing
here.

*other excerpts from home visit*
How many nights would you say per week does Child V read before bed?
*PAR:
I try to get him to do it at least twice. I should do more. It depends. On Wednesday night I
definitely does not because we're not home on Wednesday nights. On weekends we do a lot of reading
and doing things together. My oldest grandkids go to the library a lot so I like to get Child V to go there.

He gets on the computer every now and again to look up things. I try to open up his understanding of
different areas but that's about it. It's not a whole lot.
**
*HV1: What is one of Child V's favorite books?
*PAR:
What's that book about, that little boy? Oh Wimpy Kid, that's exactly right. And I have to sit
and read that to him because he can't read it. But he loves that book.
**
How often do you talk with Child V about reading? Would you say never, hardly ever --?
*PAR:
Every day. We always talking. If we don't read a book we reading something besides a book. I
may not read a book -- I do read the Bible to him often, more than reading a book. He likes to hear
about -- he has Bible books and stories in his room , two of them, like thick ones. And so he loves for me
to bring those to him. So that's a big plus, over all the other books.


01-BEP
*From Open-Ended Interview*

*HV1: So we're done with the survey/questionnaire. Now I'd love to just know a little bit more about
what Child O's typical day looks like. So what time does he wake up, so he goes to bed -- what does a
typical day look like?

*PAR:
in school.

He has to be in school at 8:00, so unless -- he'll get up an hour before have to be

*HV1: So he's at school for about how long?

*PAR:

He get out at 4:00.

*HV1: What does he usually do after school?

*PAR:
He was in an afterschool program which they help him with his homework and
different things like that. But for the last couple of weeks he hadn't gone but I think he gonna be
starting back next week. So what they do there is they just -- again, like I said, they usually play games
after they finish the homework, they get out at 6:00 if they have to.

*HV1: What has he been doing now that he's not been in that program?

*PAR:

Not much.

*HV1: He'll just come home and relax?

*PAR:

Do his homework and stuff like that.

*HV1: So around what time would you say he eats and starts getting ready for bed on a typical night?

*PAR:

_____________ 9:00, 9:30.

*HV1: We're interested in learning some more about Child O's interests so we can get him some books
he really likes. So where would you say he gets most of his books from?

*PAR:

_______ library.

*HV1: Library? Would this be the school library or this a nearby library?

*PAR:

Nearby library, yeah.

*HV1: So what are some things that you do to help Child O become a good reader?

*PAR:

Listen to him when he reading and not tell him to read out loud. And stuff.

*HV1: Are there other things you do?

*PAR:

If he don't understand a word, help him.

*HV1: So related to that, if he comes and he's having a hard time reading a book is there anything you
do to help him?

*PAR:
If I don't understand the definition or whatever I go to the dictionary. I go
definitely -- ain't any shame, I goes to look. Grandma don't know and let me just check this out.

*HV1: I have to do that all the time. That's good. Anything else you do if he's having a hard time like,
"This book is too hard for me," or is there anything that --?

*PAR:
I'll tell him, if he feel like it's too hard I just say, "You can get another one until
you work yourself up to that."

*HV1: What if it's just like a word or a sentence that's too hard?

*PAR:

For him?

*HV1: Yeah.

*PAR:

Or both. Let's just say for him. You know the ________.

*HV1: For him I'll try to help him the best I can. That's the best I can do right there. So what are some
things that you do to help him? Are there certain questions or things you say?

*PAR:
If I don't know this -- I said a little while ago if I don't know I'll look it up, try to
find out. Then I get him whatever answer I have. If not I would tell him to write it down and go to his
teacher the next day, something to that effect, yeah.

*HV1: That's great. So what are some questions that you ask Child O when you talk about the books
that he's read?

*PAR:
Try to understand what the story's about and if he got a quiz or something like
that afterward; this way he'll be after that -- answer the question once he found out what he reading
about and stuff like that.

*HV1: So are there any other people in the home that he reads with or reads to?

*PAR:

Not right now because they just visiting.

*HV1: Is there anything that you do to help make him want to read more, to motivate him to read?

*PAR:

Just keep encouraging him, yeah.

*HV1: What does that encouragement look like?

*PAR:
It's to continuously encourage him, meaning like you need to tell him what life is
about. You need to really read because this is what's going to -- you need to comprehend what you read
and stuff to that effect and do that before you get into playing.

*Other coded excerpts from home visit*
*HV1: Tell me a little about Child O as a kid.
*PAR: He still need a little help in comprehension and reading, period. So this is good for him
because he don't really like to read, you know what I'm saying? You really have to shove a book in his -you know what I mean? In order for him to really get into it, like cartoon books and stuff that I think
third graders should be sort of like past, books like that, easy books. The counter books I don't think it
matters so far what he been reading, as long as it's funny and stuff like that. But as far as third grade
reading I think he should be ______ at. Kind of past that.


01-AWK
*HV1: Okay, so now we’re going to go to the open ended questions. We’re interested in knowing the
kinds of things you and Child D do in your everyday routines, so tell me about a typical day for Child D,
from morning to bedtime as well as you can remember.
*PAR: Okay, so in the morning – I’ll start from the morning. He gets up. He takes his shower if he
hasn’t done so (background conversations) the night before. He eats breakfast.
Then I give him his medicine for his ADHD. Then he walks to the curb, to his bus stop. When he comes
home from school from 5:00 to 6:00 is a designated homework time. Even though that is a complete
struggle, even if not the whole hour, I try to do something associated with school from 5:00 to 6:00 or
5:00 to 5:30 and then after that, it’s up to him what he wanna do, whether it’s playing his game or
watching a movie, but he knows he has to do something associated with school after he come home and
get his snack.
*HV1: Okay.
*PAR: I’ll give him something to eat, and then he does homework. Then he does what he wanna do ‘til
about 8:00. Then it’s shower time after 8:00, and it was dinner and then he takes his shower last.
*HV1: Okay.
*PAR: And then it’s bedtime by 10:00.
*HV1: Okay, sounds good. We’re interested in learning more about your child’s books and reading
interests. Child D is showing (Home Visitor) some books right now. Where did he get most of his books
from?
*PAR: He’ll get books from the library.
*HV1: From the library, okay.
*PAR: But I had bought books. I buy those from – like if the library has a sale or a book fair. If he
comes home, he does typically come home every now and then with a book fair catalog and he’ll see
something he like and he’ll let me know and we’ll definitely get a book from there.
*HV1: So with most of the books that he have, would you say he got them from the public library or
the library from school?
*PAR: Public library.
*HV1: Okay. What are some things that you do to help Child D become a good reader?
*PAR: I do try to encourage him, let him know how important it is. He sees me reading frequently and
he looks at me, but he ____ ____ I don’t like that, but I really just try to encourage him to read
something if it’s not nothing but a comic book or something about Spongebob or something.
*HV1: (Crosstalk) And modeling. Modeling is a good – because we see you ____ ____ ______.
*PAR: Yeah.

*HV1: So ____ ____ ______.
*PAR: And my other daughter, she has picked up on it. She loves to read. It’s just not Child D’s thing
though.
*HV1: Right, so what, if anything, do you do when your child has a hard time with a book?
*PAR: I read it to him.
*HV1: Okay.
*PAR: And we’ll go word for word, finger pointing at the word, and I’ll read to him. He likes that better
than him doing it on his own, but I don’t think that he gets – that’s nothing compared to him actually
reading himself.
*HV1: Right. What are some questions that you ask Child D when you talk about books that he’s read?
*PAR: I ask him about characters. Well, what did this character do? I’ll ask him about the beginning of
the story, and although – I ask him different – I’ll stop. In order for me to get a good response or the
right response, I’ll have to stop and say, “What did they do again?” If I let him go through the whole
story and then ask him at the end, he doesn’t remember.
*HV1: Right.
*PAR: Or he’s confusing it with another character.
*HV1: Okay, so what, if anything, do you do to motivate him to read?
*PAR: Just get him books that he likes. I’ll take him to the library and he’ll definitely pick out
something he likes. Even though it’s not educational, but if it’s like a Spongebob book, or an Iron Man
book, or a Spiderman book, I’ll just let him pick out what he likes and he will read it.
*HV1: Okay, that’s good, so are there other people in the home that help Child D with reading?
*PAR: It’s just me and his sister ____ _____ brother, and she has – it’s just me because she can’t
tolerate him.
*HV1: Okay. How do you know when he’s reading that he’s done a good job reading?
*PAR: When he’s able to answer the questions and actually know, and that usually takes me and him
reading together. When he can answer the questions correctly about what’s going on in the story.
*HV1: Okay, so if he reads a book by himself and you ask him those questions that we talked about
earlier, if he can answer those questions?
*PAR: Mm-hmm.
*HV1: Okay, so what makes a good third grade reader, so from what you know about just him being in
third grade so far?
*PAR: Someone who’s consistent with reading.
*HV1: Okay.

*PAR: So I think consistency will make a third grade reader, even if you don’t know all the words and
you’re confused about what’s going on, but if you keep reading, even if it’s the same book for the rest of
the week.
*HV1: Right.
*PAR: Eventually at the end of the week, you’re gonna know that book like the back of your hand.
*HV1: So consistent with the words?
*PAR: Yes.
*HV1: Okay, all right, so I guess if they’re reading a book and there’s a word that is maybe, let’s see, a
third grade word, maybe please, so consistently being able to read that word throughout the book?
*PAR: And knowing what’s going on.
*HV1: Okay, so what do you think a good third grade reader should be able to do?
*PAR: Read and tell you about the story, tell you about the book, definitely. They should be able to
know the note. I mean once they’re reading, they should be able to repeat to you what the book was
about.
*HV1: Right. All right, so how would you describe Child D’s reading skills?
*PAR: Child D’s reading skills are not where they should be.
*HV1: Okay.
*PAR: But he’s definitely working on it, and I think this will help him a lot. This little program will help
him a lot, but we’re definitely working. They’re not where they should be, because he just has no
interest in educational things.
*HV1: Okay, so when he reads, what are some things that you see that you feel like he could work on?
*PAR: He can definitely work on remembering what happened.
*HV1: Yeah.
*PAR: Because like I said, I’ll have to stop in the middle of the story and say, “What did they do again,”
or, “What was her brother’s name?” If I take it all the way through, there’s a chance I’m not gonna get
the correct feedback.
*HV1: Okay, so what goals do you have for him reading this summer?
*PAR: Just keep pushing him to read, keep pushing him to do stuff, no matter how frustrated he get or
how he express he don’t want to. I feel like I should just keep pushing and being consistent with him
about reading. Just school, period because ____ _____ to work on it.
*HV1: All right, so that’s all the questions for the open ended questions and the other questions, so
now we’re just waiting for them to finish, and then we’ll explain the recorder and what you need to do
over the summer.

*PAR: Perfect.

*OTHER CODED EXCERPTS FROM HOME VISIT*
*HV1: So we really want to learn more about Child D, so can you just tell me a little bit about him?
*PAR: Child D, he’s a third grader. He attends (Name) Elementary. He has ADHD. He’s a very sweet
child, but at times he gets this attitude. He has this attitude that if things aren’t going his way or if we’re
not doing what he wants to do, it becomes a problem for him, and I think that’s where he struggles at in
school, because he doesn’t take school seriously enough to where he doesn’t have as much interest in
school, enough to pay attention and focus and do the things he’s required to do.

*HV1: So we’re interested in knowing the kinds of things that you and Child M do in a normal day. So if
you were to think about a normal routine for her, from the time she gets up to the time she goes to bed
– can you walk me through that?

*PAR: Okay. Getting up?

[Laughter]

Okay. Having to call Child M several times to get up. Because she refuses to get up most
mornings. She’ll finally get up. She’ll go to the bathroom. She’ll bathe, get dressed, and turn on the TV
until it’s time to go.

Then she’ll finish up – or sometimes she’ll fix her lunch. And then she’ll go next door to my Dad’s.
Because my dad takes her to school.

*HV1: Okay.

*PAR: And she’ll – whatever else she didn’t do here, she’ll finish up over there. And sometimes she’ll
go back to sleep. She’ll go to school. When I get home, she – the first thing she does – she tells me
about her day. That’s number one.

*HV1: Uh-huh.

*PAR: Then she’ll tell me – we’ll discuss what we’re gonna eat, what we’re gonna do. And then, after
that, the first thing she’ll head out – is the TV. Cut on the TV.

Sometimes she’ll go outside and play, or sometimes she’ll play her piano or her guitar or other things.
And then after she eats dinner, she gets ready for bed.

*HV1: Okay. And we’re interested in learning more about her reading interests and what kinds of
books she likes. And she’s showing (Home Visitor) some of her books right now, as you know.

*PAR: Uh-huh.

*HV1: Our question for you is – where have you gotten most of her books from?

*PAR: Most of her books were either school – where they have the school book thing.

*HV1: Like a school book fair?

*PAR: Yes.

*HV1: Okay.

*PAR: Or her aunt – gave her a lot of those books.

*HV1: Okay.

*PAR: Because her aunt passed. And she was a school teacher. So she had a lot of books, so she was
like, “Child M will enjoy these.” So a lot of 'em – she just gave 'em to her. Sometimes we’ll go to WalMart or Toys ‘R Us and get books.

*HV1: Uh-huh. Okay. Great. Thanks. And what are some things that you do to help Child M become a
good reader?

*PAR: Kumon. Pay for that every month.

*HV1: Yeah. I was gonna say that. Uh-huh.

[Laughter]

*PAR: Yes. I pay for that every month – makes sure she goes every – twice a week. And I talk to her
about it. You know?

Sometimes I will pull things off the Internet, where I feel that she’s having her most difficulties. I’ll go on
the Internet and figure out something for her age – well, for her grade. Excuse me. And I’ll pull it, and
I’ll work with her on it – a worksheet. You know? And I’ll help her like that.

*HV1: Okay. Great. And what, if anything, do you do when you see that she’s having a hard time with
a book?

*PAR: Child M’s problem with – when she does read, and I hear her reading – is breaking down the
words.

*HV1: Okay.

*PAR: You know? She’ll say a word she doesn’t know, and she’ll make up a word. And I’m like, “No.
Sound it out.” You know?

*HV1: Uh-huh.

*PAR: And I’ll help her sound it out, and try to teach her how to sound it out. That was the most
difficult thing that we have ever experienced – is her sounding out. But she’s getting better at sounding
out.

*HV1: Uh-huh.

*PAR: Telling her to slow down.

*HV1: Okay.

*PAR: You know? Don’t just call out words. You know? Speak – when she talks, do it fluently. You
know? Don’t chop up the words.

And so just keep taking her back to – even if we have to just stay on one page until she gets it right, we’ll
just stay on that one page. And then I’ll say, “Okay. We’ll work on the rest of it later.” You know?

*HV1: Okay. So pacing her?

*PAR: Yes.

*HV1: Yeah. Okay. What are some questions that you ask her when you talk to her about books that
she’s read?

*PAR: I ask her – usually I try to find out if she can comprehend what she read. Because that’s where
she’s having her most difficulties – is comprehending it. You know? So I ask her some questions to see
if she’s getting what she’s reading.

*HV1: Okay.

[Interruption]

*HV1: So. I’m sorry. You were talking about the questions that you ask her.

*PAR: I’m just making sure that she is understanding what she is reading. You know?

*HV1: Okay.

*PAR: I’ll go back with her. You know? “What is the story about? Who are the characters? What are
you getting out of it?” So yeah.

*HV1: Okay. Great. What, if anything, do you do to motivate her to read?

*PAR: I don’t do anything to motivate her to read. I just – I always stay on her about her reading. You
know? “Child M, you know you’ve got to do this.” You know? Trying to find out where her weaknesses
are. But to like really motivate her to say, “Let’s read”?

Because that’s my weakness. I hate reading.

*HV1: Hmm.

*PAR: Yeah. So I think – math was my stronger subject. Reading was my –

*HV1: Well, she followed in her mama’s shoes.

*PAR: Yes.

[Laughter]

*HV1: You know I think it’s easier to get better at reading than to get better at math.

*PAR: Really?

*HV1: Because math either clicks for you, or it doesn’t. I mean this is my humble opinion. What do I
know? But reading – you can always get – but math – it’s just like kids are on it, or they’re not.

*PAR: Yeah.

*HV1: Yeah.

*PAR: And I don't know what it is about math. I can get math like it wasn’t nothing. But reading?

*HV1: Yeah. We need more girls who are good at math in the classroom. So when she said math, I
was like, “Yes. Go girl.”

*PAR: Yes. She did excellent. She made a 4 on her EOGs with math.

*HV1: Good for her.

*PAR: Yes. And when she said about her reading – I was like, “Yep. She took after her mom.”

*HV1: Good for her.

*PAR: But yeah. She did a 4. I was proud of her. Well, definitely – I’m like, “Yes.”

*HV1: I bet you were. Wow. Hmm. And are there other people in the home that help her with
reading?

*PAR: Yes. Well, not in the home. But I kind of include my dad and his wife.

*HV1: You include your dad? Okay.

*PAR: Because they are like right next door, and they take care of Child M while I’m at work.

*HV1: Okay.

*PAR: So they do. They make sure that like every day she has some type of Kumon homework.
Because they give her like six packets to read and do questionnaires. You know? So they make sure she
goes through that every day and everything.

And we try to – I had bought her some books. And sometimes we try to get her to read it and answer
the questions, to see if she’s comprehending what she’s reading.

So they stay on her more than I can. Because by the time I get home, usually it’s like around this time.
And sometimes it’s a little later, based on what I have to do. So I don’t have the time to like really sit
down with Child M and help her through it. So they do it for me.

*HV1: Okay. Great. Well, it’s wonderful that you have that support.

*PAR: Yes. It’s my support. I am grateful.

*HV1: It’s so nice they live so close. And how do you know if Child M has done a good job of reading a
book?

*PAR: My dad’s wife – she sits with Child M most of the time, when it comes to her reading.

*HV1: Okay.

*PAR: And she informs me of what’s going on. And so that’s how I keep up with what she’s having
problems with, and what she’s not having problems with, and what she’s getting better at.

And that’s how I know if I need to go online and pull another worksheet off for Child M or whatever, to
assist her in whatever she’s having problems with.

*HV1: Uh-huh.

*PAR: So that’s what we usually do.

*HV1: Okay. So that helps me know what other people are doing as well. That’s great.

*PAR: Uh-huh.

*HV1: So I guess to maybe reiterate the question – is there an indicator for you? How do you know if
she’s gotten a book or done a good job of reading a book? Or maybe you’re not around to have –
maybe that’s more your dad’s wife’s turn –

*PAR: Yeah.

*HV1: Okay. So we would need to ask her then.

*PAR: Yeah. She does it more.

*HV1: Got it. And what do you think makes a good third grade reader? What should they be able to
do? I know. If you’re not a teacher, you’re like, “What?” But just in your own estimation –

*PAR: Okay. Based on what me and her teacher talked about, when it comes to it –

*HV1: Sure.

*PAR: She’s saying that reading more fluent is the main thing. You know? Not chopping up the words
or guessing at words. Being able to recognize the words. You know? Reading.

*HV1: Okay.

*PAR: Pronunciation. You know? That’s what she tells me.

*HV1: Okay.

*PAR: So yeah.

*HV1: That’s great. And how would you describe Child M’s reading skills? I know you’ve already
alluded to this. But if you could formally say it, that’d be helpful.

*PAR: It’s a little weak.

*HV1: Okay.

*PAR: She still needs some help on her reading. So yeah.

*HV1: Okay. Can’t be good at math and reading all the time. You know? Some kids are blessed
enough to be good at both. But most of the time, it’s one or the other.

*PAR: One or the other. Yes.

*HV1: I was certainly – I was the reading kid. I couldn’t do math to save my life.

*PAR: And I was the math kid.

*HV1: Yeah?

*PAR: Reading – ugh.

*HV1: And what goals do you have for Child M’s reading this summer?

*PAR: For her to at least get to the level she’s supposed to be at in reading. You know?

*HV1: Okay.

*PAR: That she can read more fluent, that she can comprehend better. And that she’ll start liking to
read. I hope she doesn’t take after her mom and just hate reading.

*HV1: Okay.

*PAR: I’m hoping that she’ll just learn to start enjoying the books. You know? But I think the problem
is that if you can’t comprehend what you’re reading, then you can’t enjoy what you’re reading.

*HV1: Exactly. Exactly.

*PAR: So just getting her to the point where she can comprehend what she’s reading – I think she’ll
start liking to read or read more.

*HV1: That makes sense. Yeah. Great. Thanks for answering all my questions.

*PAR: You’re welcome.


01-AHT
*From open-ended interview*
*HV1: It's hard to find time to just sit and -- like a luxury. Would you say that -- I think that's the end of
that survey.

Now I'm going to ask you just the kinds of things you do, like your
everyday routines. So tell me about a typical day with Child D
from when he wakes up to bedtime.

*PAR:
Okay. When he wakes up in the morningtime ___________ if he have to go to
school he don't like to get up but it's a bad situation on him. And he whines -- I mean I get him up at
5:30. He ___________ lay down. I get him up at quarter to 6:00. He ____ 15 minutes put your clothes
on. I come in there he still in bed just sitting there. "Honey you got your clothes on?" "No not yet."
Okay I go to the bathroom, do what I got to do, he still setting there like 15 after 6:00 we leaving at 6:30,
he still sitting there with no clothes on and he ain't done anything. So what I have doing here lately is
putting him on punishments like can't go outside and play with your friends, you can't look at TV,
___________. And I try to, instead of whipping him I try to take stuff away from him that I know he
really enjoy doing.

He does good on a school day, I don't have no problem with him in school, it just between here
in the morning times and he get back in the afternoon 'cause he used to be in afterschool program but
___________ I took him out of the program and let him stay home and __________ I'm like it's not
good, it's not great 'cause they can't get along at all. They fuss all the time. That's how I know because
when I check his homework at nighttime I can see he rushed through it and might got a lot of answers
wrong. But "I read it and I didn't understand." Okay so he didn't ask questions. And then if he can't get
no help then yeah, you have to wait until I get home. But typical day with him sometime is hard.

*HV1: What is the nighttime routine?

*PAR:
Between 7:30, 8 o'clock it's time for him to come in the house if he outside. It
takes him an hour just to get in the bathroom and take a bath 'cause I tell him get in the bathroom, take
a bath. He'll go in there and he just setting in there and I'm like, " Child D you in the tub?" "Not yet, I'm
planning to get in there." But ______ time to get in there he's still sitting in there playing. So I say,
"Well I'm going to beat you," he like, "I'm getting in the tub." He never gets in the tub. So I guess he
have to feel that I'm coming in there where he at and he'll jump in the tub. It's okay but it could be

better. When I say get in tub, you know, get in tub then. And then I ______say ___ getting punishment
and stuff like.

*HV1: And what time does he usually go to bed like around?

*PAR:
I try to get him in there between 9:00, no later than 9:30. I know sometimes we
be up late 'cause if I get out of work late that means I still got to come home and check his homework
make sure his homework is done and then I know he got to eat. He's still got to take a bath because
sometime when I get home he still ain't took no bath yet. So try to get him to bed between 9:00 and
9:30 but sometime he be up to like 10:00, 11:00, all depends on what he's doing and stuff like that.

*HV1: We're interested in learning more about just Child D’s books and reading interests so Child D is
showing (Home Visitor) some of his books right now. So where do you think Child D gets most of his
books? Like from the library or teachers?

*PAR:

From the library. He get library books like every other day.

*HV1: Nice. So there's a pretty good library at school?

*PAR:
Yeah. I know last year I mean I had more fun with him last year than I did this
year. This year's like I don’t know if it's getting harder for him or he just slacked on reading. He used to
bring books home; we used to read all the time last year. This teacher was giving him books and there
were like ten books in that bag. We're reading books for like two weeks. So they got some good books
___________ just about him going there and finding stuff that he wants. He ___________ like the Black
Lagoon books then like, "Oh they done run out of them." I said, "_______ what can we read now?" And
then he feel -- the next thing he got out was the Wimpy one. He got into them. He had like five of them
but he didn't read all of them 'cause some of them was friends gave it to him. He was reading them but
I don't know if it got boring to him or some of the words were too hard but I know some of the words
__________________ to say. So I think _________________. But the only one I see here he's
______________, the one he's reading that I just got ________ after Christmas. He's holding onto that
one ________________________ the rest of them.

*HV1: So the blue Diary of a Wimpy Kid book?

*PAR:

Mhm.

*HV1: So what are some of the things you do to help Child D become a good reader?

*PAR:
Make him read more. I guess I just have to stay on him and make sure that he's
reading or just set him beside me so I know he's reading. 'Cause I know sometimes he be reading he be
falling asleep and what I do I make him stand up and read and then he'll wake up.

*HV1: What about when Child D comes across a word he doesn't understand?

*PAR:
What I do at first I tell him to sound it out and see how he does. And if it's two
words I try and tell him to split the words up and see what is this word right here? What's this word?
Now put both of them together. I work with him on that. We did that in first grade so we been doing
that ever since first grade. He does it now but before I tell him what the word is he have to sound it out
because some words he know I don't even know. He'll tell me what it is, he'll try to correct me.

*HV1: What about is there anything you do to help him understand what he reads better? If he reads
a passage and he's reading it but he just isn't understanding what it says.

*PAR:
Yeah, we did it ______ his homework. They were asking him about -- it was like
door prizes and stuff like that on his homework and he would read it but he didn't understand how
much is this right here if you add all this up, especially if you got like two things at the same price. He
got confused on it and I was asking him the question because I didn't want to give him the answer right
then but he was still trying to maybe give an answer but after a while he figured it out and I said, "Okay,
this is what you have to -- you have to read to understand. If you don't understand, read it again.
There's no stopping one time when you read it. So I have to stay on him about that too 'cause he like to
read one -- if you read one time he don't want to read it no more.

*HV1: So you just tell him don't give up and then you just ask him questions as opposed to --

*PAR:

Giving up so quick.

*HV1: That's a great strategy. You've answered this but what do you do when Child D is having a hard
time with a book?

*PAR:
Well I mean if he had a hard time reading it and some of the words I try to help
him with it but most of the time if he got another ________________ choose another book or
something like that or let's go get your book off the book shelf we'll read that one.

*HV1: Good.

*PAR:
But most of the time I try to give him a choice but sometimes he get angry or
wants to get mad with it you're going to have to read it anyway so you can get mad you can say, "I don't
care," he going to have to figure it out 'cause sometimes he can get stuff and he don't want to do it so I
have to make him actually sit down and figure it out or yeah, you're going to read that book before you
do this before you do that. He'll pick in his mind well I know I got to do this I got to go outside so I'm
going to have to read.

*HV1: You mentioned that you ask him some questions like if he's having trouble with the _____.
What are some of the questions that you would ask?

*PAR:
Okay some of the questions I ask him is like what did they ask you to do?
________________ what they asking you to say. They say add two eggrolls together, how you going to
add two eggrolls together and then you understand what they asking you do and especially it was that
movie thing that he was reading and they say, "Well what time did the movie start?" Evenings. What
time did the evenings start? He put like the morning start, he didn't understand like it didn't -- why you
do that so I think you got to read to understand what you're reading.

*HV1: You've mentioned a couple of these things but what do you do to motivate Child D to read, to
make him want to read more? Is there anything --

*PAR:
For him to say _____ going to fourth grade then you're going to have to read
more, you're going to have to get your reading level up so therefore the way he doing EOG now I said in
order for you to pass that you know you got to read, you got to read. So I try to motivate him to read
more. Even if I'm not here _____________ I mean books is in here just find your book and just read it
and sometime he do, sometime he'll pick up something but most of the time he'll pick up a toy to play
with.

*HV1: Very nice. That's the end of my questions. You guys are done too? Thank you so much. I think
the only thing we have left to do is to show you guys how the recorder works and I think (Home
Visitor’s) going to tell you guys what you're going to do with the recorder so why don't we get Child D
back in here and we can show you guys how to use it.

*Other coded excerpts from home visit*
* *PAR: Okay he's a shy person for one thing but he likes to meet different people ______ and stuff like
that. He loves to read but different books that they have in school is like he don't like them. So his
reading never was up but now it's kind of going down because he doesn't read as much as he used to
[crosstalk]. He just like to have fun.

*
*PAR: I try to read with him when I got out of work at nighttime, especially if he don't have his work
done and stuff. Basically I will do is I will read his homework to him and then I ask him to read it back to
me, especially some of the big words. We used to read the books that his teacher -- ____ go to another
teacher her like last year and she would give him books to read. And what I'll do I'll read a page and he'll
read a page. Most of the time we try to read together but we been kind of slack with _____.
**
*PAR: Well lately it's like he say he's reading at school but if he's doing his homework and stuff like that
I think some of it is ____ reading 'cause he have to read his work in order to get it. But see he reads
every night but like books and stuff -- he don't read books like he used to read every night. He used to
read a book like 30 minutes every night. And ______ Diary of a Wimpy Kid and he love them books right
there, and I bought him one and he got into it, ______ but he slipped away from it. Then he had one -- I
got him one for Christmas that you can write in it, you can write whatever you want to in it and all this
kind of stuff. He still have the one right now. _______ ain't got nobody to read it.

01-AKN
*From open-ended interview*
*HV1: That is the end of the first half -- thank you. Now I'm just going to ask you some very openended questions. First question: we're interested in knowing the kinds of things that you and Child C do
in your everyday routine. So if you were to think about a typical day for Child C from the time he wakes
up to the time that he goes to bed would you mind just laying it out for me?

*PAR:
Depends which day of the week, like Monday through Friday we get up in the
morning, he brushes his teeth, washes his face, do the hygiene, clothes, breakfast and then we go to
school -- well I drop him off at his grandmother's house and his grandmother transports him to school
because he does not have to be at school until 9:00. I have to be to work at 8:00. So from about 7:30 to
8:35 he's with his grandma, usually eating again or drinking. Then he goes to school from 9:00 to 3:30.
He gets back to my mom house 4 o'clock, he's to do his homework from 4:00 until I get off on Tuesdays
and Thursdays he has a tutor that comes out to my mom house and tutor him. So I'm working with his
tutor from 4:00 to about 5:15 I get there on Tuesdays and Thursdays. Once I pick him up we may stop
by groceries or whatever, come home. While I'm preparing meals we go back over his homework to
make sure it's correct and then we read, we do our reading after dinner, we do our reading. And if we
have time they [crosstalk]. Then we have breakdown time so ____ 8 o'clock they have to come in, they
take baths from 8:00 to 8:30 is bath time. From 8:30 to 9:00 they have to be in bed but they can have
the TV on and then after 9:00 TV is off and that's bedtime.

*HV1: That's a very perfect helpful routine to hear. And I know that right now Child C is showing
Margaret some of his books. Our question -- you've already asked this but I'm going to ask again: where
have you gotten most of his books from?

*PAR:
The book fair, my sister has two children also, one in the eighth grade, another
in the sixth grade. So with the sixth grader she pass most of her books down to me. So we just recycle
books. So I get most of my books from her.

*HV1: Okay. And what are some things that you do to help Child C become a good reader?

*PAR:
Before I just let Child C read but now that I'm more focused because this is his
third grade year. He have had a very rough year. Kindergarten, first, second grade was great. But
transitioning to third grade he have had a very rough time and I have not actually identified the exact
problem -- I don't know if it's his teacher because she's young or the children in the class because I've
never had a behavior problem out of Child C, never. But this year it's been more behavioral based that's
distracting his work. So I know every day -- if it's not every day I know it's at least three, four times a
week he comes home with a issue in class where someone either taking his papers, taking his pencils or

hitting on him or something and it distracts him. His teacher and I have had probably over 40
conferences this year about his academics and his behavior. And it's not his behavior have been
outrageous, it's just playing, or maybe defending himself from someone who has hit him or whatever.
And I don't blame anything on the teacher because I know she can't watch 30 kids and see everything
but this has just been a very rough year. I say that to say this: now that I've had conferences with the
teacher and I know Child C weak points I know that Child C for one can't concentrate -- I have to keep
him focused. Two, Child C will read a word and it may say, "any" but he'll say "and" because he see A-N.
And then he assumes that it's and. So he doesn't pay attention to what he read.

So I have gotten him to start to point at the word he's reading, and when he
points at the word he's reading he say it wrong I make him go back and actually look at the word. And
he's very lazy when it comes to reading because he rush through this words. That's one big major issue
with Child C.

*HV1: So that's one way I hear you saying you help him to become a good reader is encouraging him to
slow down, put his finger on the word so he's forced to look at it. That's great. Anything else we should
know about as far as having him -- I'm not saying he doesn't remember but I don't think Child C pay
attention to what he's reading.

*PAR:
I think he just reads and he don't process what he's reading. So each paragraph or page
I say, "Okay Child C, what happened on this page?" So he can actually take in what he's reading, he can
tell me about a book. When I say, "Child C, what happened in the book?" He'll say, "They were playing
football and they threw the football and they went home," but he don't tell what the substance is in this
book, what the problem was, who were the characters. He don't do that.

*HV1: It sounds like just slowing him down enough to focus. Okay great. You kind of answered this
one when you answered the last one but the next one is what if anything do you do when your child is
having a hard time with a book. I know you already answered that; anything you want to add?

*PAR:
When he having a difficult time with a book I make sure it's on his level. I want
him to read up just to see if he can do it. But if it's a difficult book then we'll just get another book
which is ____ another book which is a little bit easier that he can actually read and understand.

*HV1: When you see he's struggling you'll see there needs to be an adjustment in the level of the book
-- anything else?

*PAR:

Just slow him down and make sure he's comprehending what he's reading.

*HV1: What are some questions you ask Child C when you talk to him about books he's read?

*PAR:
The characters in the book, I ask him now the problem in the book -- was it any
problem in the book? Or have he ever been in that situation that happened in the book? Bullying -- we
do a lot of bullying books also because that's a big issue in school now.

*HV1: I've heard it's out of control in school right now.

*PAR:
It is. One of the conferences is about a little girl who was messing with him.
Child C is a very self-hearted little boy and I also have taught him never to hit a girl so he wouldn't hit
her back but he will always come out and say, "She keeps bothering me. I want her to leave me alone."
So we have had a conference about bullying. So if we read any book I'll ask him, "Buddy, have you ever
been through that? How would you feel --?"
*HV1: Self-application. I didn't want to get you off track when I mentioned bullying. Okay so those are
the questions you ask him, great. What if anything do you do to motivate him to read?

*PAR:
I tell Child C a lot that -- for instance I have to associate reading with everyday
life because some kids feel like reading is boring or they may not need it. So when we're out and about
and he want something and I say, "Well what is it?" he'll say, "It's a game." Well read me what the game
is about so I'll know if it's age appropriate. So tell me what the game is about. He's forced to read.
That's how I associate reading with everyday life. Or Child C, tell me the ingredients, tell me what's in it,
tell me what they are. I just associate reading with everything.

*HV1: Are there other people in the home to help him with reading besides you?

*PAR:

His sister helps when they're not fighting. She loves reading.

*HV1: What does she do when she's helping him?

*PAR:
Sits beside him, make sure -- the same thing, if I'm cooking I'll say, "Child A, help
your brother read or sit beside your brother and read." So she does the same thing I do as far as making
him look at the word and read along with him to make sure he's pronouncing the word correctly and
saying the correct word.

*HV1: How old is she?

*PAR:

She's 11.

*HV1: Anyone else in the home we should be aware of?

*PAR:
My husband is here, so he's here. He works nightly but when he is here he help
him read but majority is me and my daughter.

*HV1: Just a few more questions. How do you know if Child C has done a good job reading a book?

*PAR:
Because if he loves that book he will tell me from the front to the back of the
book. So he's excited to tell me what the book is about. That's how I know he has read that book and
comprehended it.

*HV1: What do you think a good third-grade reader should be able to do?

*PAR:
Read midway fourth-grade level. I think that a good reader should be able to
read -- a fourth grader who has been in school in the half semester.

*HV1: As a third grader? Okay. And how would you describe Child C's reading skills?

*PAR:
be.

They're strong when he concentrate. He's a very good reader when he wants to

*HV1: What goals do you have for Child C's reading this summer?

*PAR:

He's going to keep his tutoring this summer; she's not going to stop.

*HV1: This is a reading tutor?

*PAR:
She worked with him with math and reading and reading comprehension. So
I'm actually going to keep her on this summer because usually during the summer they don't do
anything but play and stay at their grandparents' house. This summer I'm putting them in summer camp
so they have things to do and I'm going to keep his tutor. So this summer I'm hoping his reading skills
get stronger. He put feeling into reading because it's your responsibility, just actually put feeling,
emotions when he reads. That's what I want him to become better at is actually reading a book and
putting emotion in there to show what the story is about because anybody can read a book but to really
take it in you have to understand what you're reading. So I just want his skills to become a little bit
stronger going into fourth grade.

*HV1: Those are all my questions for you. Thanks for your thorough, thoughtful answers. Very much
appreciated.

*Other coded excerpts from home visit*
*HV1: How many nights per week does Child C read before bed?
*PAR: Right now it's four nights a week because I'm working on my masters so I'm in school Thursday
nights. So usually on Thursday nights his grandparents keeps him and they're older. My mom is 74 so
she makes sure he does his homework. But as far as -- I tell him to read but Child C is not going to read
without supervision. So I would say four nights a week. On the weekend we usually have reading night
on Sunday nights before school.


01-BCW
*Open-ended interviews*
*HV1: Child C. Um, we’re interested in knowing the kinds of things that you and Child J do in your
everyday routine. So if you were just to think about Child J’s routine from the time she wakes up to the
time she goes to bed, on a typical day, what would that look like?

*PAR: Well when she gets up the first thing that she does is kind of wanders into the bathroom and
takes a shower. Our mornings before school are kind of hectic and crazy because you know we’re trying
to keep her focused so that we get to school on time so usually it’s just get all the necessities done,
shower, breakfast, teeth brushed, backpack packed, out the door. When she gets home from school
about 3:30 we have a snack and then straight into homework, and you know, homework usually consists
of reading for at least twenty minutes, usually it’s more like a half hour or forty-five minutes. And then
whatever math and spelling assignments that she has. Generally after that, either she and I go into the
kitchen and she starts helping me with whatever she can for dinner, or she hits the shower, because
usually she needs one at the end of the day. You know, so, during that half hour either she and I are
cooking together or she’s taking a shower, we sit down as a family and eat dinner, and then once, her
bed time is 9:00 PM so that golden period between 7:00 PM and 9:00 PM we try our best to do
something outside with her. Sometimes Child C makes that impossible but we try our best to go outside
for a little bit, you know, wherever possible, we play a game of some sort. Like for example last night
was pretty typical, after we ate, Child C went to bed about 8:00 PM and we spend the last hour
together, we played two hands of Uno and then read like three chapters out of “The Storybook Bible”,
and then we all went to bed, or well, put her to bed, and then that’s the day and start it over again.

*HV1: Okay great that’s super thorough and helpful, thank you. And we’re interested in learning more
about her books, her reading interests. And we know we already talked about it and I know that she’s
showing (Home Visitor) one of her books right now. Our question for you is where has she gotten most
of her books from?

*PAR:

I would say her grandparents, the aforementioned nine of them.

*HV1:

Okay, okay, I am sure she must just be sure spoiled with nine.

*PAR: Pretty much, yeah, it’s hard to try to reign them in. For example for her birthday last year we
said no extravagant gifts and my parents, which, I’m grateful for this gift, but they gave her a kindle. So
now since they live at a great distance they can, rather than buying and sending books which is extra
postage, excuse me, they have three kindles all networked together so they just buy one and download
it to theirs and it automatically goes on hers.

*HV1:

I never thought about that.

*PAR:

I thought it was brilliant too.

*HV1:

That’s so cool.

*PAR: So they’ll buy her random books here and there and send me an email saying, “We got Child J a
new book”, and I’ll plug it in and there it is.

*HV1:

Oh awesome, how fun.

*PAR: And she likes it too because it’s a gadget, you know. But her other grandparents buy her actual
– I’m old school so they’re like do you want books or do you want more Amazon stuff and I’m like I want
books, so they buy her things that we can take on the go that don’t require batteries and things like
that, so she gets lots of books from her grandparents.

*HV1:

So they’re like the primary source.

*PAR:

Yeah, oh definitely.

*HV1:

Are there any other sources we should be aware of?

*PAR: Well, the library given that it’s right there. We try to hit them as often as possible. Um, Child J
has a stepmother who home schools her two children, so she gets some books that way as well but
again, grandparents are the primary source.

*HV1: Okay, and what are some things that you do to help her become a good reader?

*PAR: I try to encourage her to read as much as possible. Primarily because I think her reading
comprehension, and I ask questions about, I try to read books that I’ve read, or have her read books that
I’ve read before that I recall the story line so that I can talk to her about the book and try to help her

with her comprehension because It kind of sometimes doesn’t stick. Like for example the Bunnicula
series, I got that for her because I’ve read them I don’t know how many times as a kid and knew to ask
various questions. And it seems to be that if I recall a book that I’ve read and recount the story, you
know, like a synopsis too she kind of gets interested in it, that way. And also we’ve gone to the library
and talked to the children’s section librarians about different books and their enthusiasm gets her into it
too.

*HV1:

Oh, I bet they’re an awesome resource.

*PAR: Oh yeah, yeah, yeah we found a number of books and series that we could either get from the
kindle or borrowed from the library, we didn’t know anything about. Especially mysteries, I was never
into mysteries so they have been a great source for that.

*HV1: Does, um, the mystery books I read, I’m getting off track, the mystery books I read when I was a
kid were Boxcar, Nancy Drew, does she read those at all?

*PAR: That was one of the ones he suggested that he put on our list. Nancy Drew for sure, that one, it
was just a no brainer, but yeah, we definitely out the Boxcar and the Nancy Drew on the list because he
had suggested that and when she heard about the plot line she was into it. Woah, do you need some
help? Child C’s outside. And another thing that I try to do to is I try to be intentional about reading in
front of her whether it’s for pleasure or otherwise says that you know it’s, just you know, just kind of
part of life to her, you know? Just lead by example.

*HV1: Just an example, yeah, great. Um, and what if anything do you do when you see that she’s
having a hard time with a book?

*PAR: Um, I try to help her, a lot of times it’s definitions that she’s struggling with, like she can get the
word but she just doesn’t know what it means, so you know I try to give her a good you know, age
appropriate definition of something, um, and just you know kind of maybe take that work out and
replace it with a synonym that she might get so she understands. Yeah, usually it’s not so much ____;
it’s usually that she doesn’t know what something means, so we just try to work through that.

*HV1: Okay, great, okay. And what are some, you mentioned that you ask her questions. What are
some of the questions that you do ask her when you talk to her about books she’s read?

*PAR: Well for example, with the Shel Silverstein poetry books, um, you know I’ve asked her about
what are your favorite poems, what are some of the pictures she noticed in the book, did you read this
poem yet, you know, what, I’m trying to think, my mind is going blank ________ right now, but you
know, just try to recall some of the names that are read in them and just see if she’s hit that yet or not
because part of it is for reading comprehension and also to make sure she actually read it, you know.
Because that can sometimes be a problem too, yeah sure I read it, and then you find out later no, you
read the cover. But um, yeah, those types of questions are like you know, tell me something about
character A, you know, like what, what was mom’s reaction to Bunnicula in the first book? When she
first, you know, yeah I know, that’s why I thought about it, because I saw you showing Margaret, but
yeah, you know, what was, how did mom feel when the vegetables were drained, you know, that kind of
thing.

*HV1: Great, um and what if anything do you do to motivate her to read? And you’ve already touched
on this but I’ll just ask you formally.

*PAR: Yeah, um, I mean it, honestly it can be a struggle. So there have been times where, I mean, I
hate to admit it out loud because it sounds, it tastes awful in my moth but sometimes there’s kind of
twisting, but you know, we also try to do things like her father and stepmother, stepfather and I have
kind of devised a plan for the summer that you know if she completes a book on her own, once she’s
completed x amount of books, we haven’t kind of figured out the numbers yet, but after she’s finished x
amounts of books or ____ many, however long, then we’re going to take her to um, I think one of the
things was like if she completes two books or one that is significantly long then we’ll go to one of the
museums in Springville, or we’ll go to the Jumping Beans, or something like that, like, you know, give
her some kind of substantial reward without it being an object, you know, so that’s one thing we’re
going to kind of kick around but you know, again um, she likes the family aspect of reading, like reading
together so we try to do that together because I know that’s something that she enjoys and you know,
she enjoys reading to us so we try to foster that. You know, and um, I think that’s about it.

*HV1: That’s very helpful, thank you. And, were you going to say something?

*PAR:

No.

*HV1: Okay, um, and I’m just going to see where they’re at before I go any further. Okay. Okay, we’re
actually just, okay so I’m going to ask you four questions, because we have time. Um, are there other
people in the home that help her with reading?

*PAR: Yeah, my husband Parent R does. My husband Parent R does, he pretty much the same kind of
thing, um, he, I’ll admit, he’s a little better at trying to get her to use context clues than I am, I’m usually

____ on the spot with the definition, but he works more with her trying to get her to figure out what the
context clues, how that would help her define whatever word it is. And he gives, he tends to give her a
broader sense of what you know, where I would come in and say okay well the definition is whatever it
is, he would give her a bigger sense of how that word works in the storyline. Okay, does that make
sense?

*HV1: That makes perfect sense, okay. And what is an indicator for you that Child J has done a good
job reading her books?

*PAR: Um, her enthusiasm, and by that I mean how much she wants to talk about it. I mean usually,
for example books that come home from school, I can’t tell when she’s picked it out and when she’s
been told to read a book. Because when she’s picked it out she comes home and she’s like you know,
talking about it and excited about it and just wants me to read it and all of these sorts of things. Versus
like for example a book that they just finished, um, it’s not, she’s not really keeping the information, you
know. Um, I feel like she’s reading it to answer the questions on the page versus actually enjoying the
book so that has a lot to do with it too. If I hear her talk about it, I know we’re good.

*HV1: Okay got it, that’s great. Just let me know if I need to let you go at any time. What in your
opinion makes a good third grade reader, so what should a good third grade reader be able to do?

*PAR:

Hmm, that’s a tough question.

*HV1:

Yeah that is, unless you’re a teacher, _________.

*PAR: ______________. Um, I think, gosh I really don’t know how to answer that, I would say
probably maybe this is sticking in my head because it is a struggle for Child J but I think a good sense of
um, the beginning, middle, and end of the story, like where we’re going, um, and the ability to sound
out words which she’s really good at. She may not, she may not know what she’s saying but she can at
least sound it out.

*HV1:

Sound it out, she’s got that part down.

*PAR: Yeah she’s got that part down for sure. And I also think that a good third grader knows to ask
questions, but aside from that I’m drawing a blank.

*HV1: That, I think you covered all the bases, that sounds great. And how would you describe Child J’s
reading skills?

*PAR: I think they’re pretty good, up until this year she had been in an accelerated program. This year
we’ve kind of peaked at just above her grade level. But I’d say that she’s you know, when interested in
the subject matter she’s a great reader. She, it’s one of the few things that she can focus on.

*HV1: Okay, okay. Yeah it sounds like she’s got so many varied interests and there’s always something
new.

*PAR: Yeah, there’s usually something to read because of those varied interests.

*HV1: Yeah, I could imagine. And final questions, and you’ve actually already addressed that, but what
goals do you have for her reading this summer? You already talked about your plans.

*PAR: Yeah, I’d like to see the frequency increase. I’d also like to see her comprehension kind of you
know, just build up a little bit more and I think a lot of that has to do with right now just finding a subject
that she enjoys reading about or just good stories, that kind of thing. Um, you know, that way she kind
of gets a little better focus on it and you know, the motivation comes because if we can find something
that’s gripping enough then she’ll want to come to fruition. But yeah, I mean that’s basically it, my main
goal is just to see the frequency of her fun reading increase, you know, rather than forced, because I
have to do this for school.

*HV1: Yeah, that makes sense. Great. Well thank you. Those are all my questions for you.


01-AYI
*open-ended*
*HV1: Great. Now I'll just ask you a series of open-ended questions. So first off we're interested in
knowing the kind of things you do in your everyday routine, so if you were to think about what a typical
day looks like for him from the time he wakes up to the time he goes to bed; can you walk me through
that?

*PAR:

Like weekends or more weekday?

*HV1: You can focus on weekdays.

*PAR:
Okay, dressed, wash face, brush teeth, rush to the car, goes to before-school,
we usually get there around 7:00. He does whatever he does there, they read, play games, they eat
breakfast, he goes to class, does school, ___________ that they do, but I'm not there. Then he goes to
after-school most days; if not he's a car-rider where they can do homework, read, play games -- it
depends on the day of the week. Home somewhere between 4:00 and 5:30, homework if it's not
already done, which it's usually done, swimming lessons -- it depends on the time of the year too, so
swimming lessons, if there was any -- dinner, depending on ______ lessons are, dinner, bathing, settling
down for the night. There's usually some sort of TV or computer game in there at some point or
another, not every day but most days. To bed, to read for a little bit hopefully, most days, and sleep.

*HV1: Okay.

*PAR:

That's probably about it.

*HV1: Great. And we're interested in learning more about what types of books interest him, and I
know that he is showing (Home Visitor) some right now. And our question for you is where does he get
most of his books? Where are they from?

*PAR:
I guess -- well, I don't know, from home or from school. He doesn't really get
books from school but he gets ideas because I know his teacher they had earlier this year, before she
went to the EC department she represented this series, and so we're reading The Twits and other books
so he got some of those because I know he can't necessarily bring those books home. So I bought a set
of those books. I guess _______________.

*HV1: So where are you buying your books from? Because it sounds like you get recommendations
from the school but then you go out and buy them?

*PAR:
Yeah, because the library, again, especially for anything as popular it gets hard
to -- because we were reading Secrets of Droon and it got really -- I didn't want to buy them because
there's like a gazillion of them but getting them from the library was really tedious and I'd have to
reserve them and ______ pick them up. So I usually got the sets are either Amazon or Costco usually, if
it's a set. Otherwise Borders before they closed and now Barnes & Noble I guess.

*HV1: Great. And next question: what are some things you do to help Child C become a good reader?

*PAR:
I don't know. _________________________ how you teach people to read; you
just read. I guess what I was thinking about -- I don't know if we do it as much with the books we read, it
depends on the book. But I know the Percy Jackson gets into being -- what seems realistic or why do
you think he did that? What did we read about last time? Because we started one and we started
reading another book and we came back and we had to figure out where we were and what happened,
and I really got into them and we finished them; I had to go back and [whispering]. So I try to ask
questions; I'm probably not as good [whispering].

*HV1: At asking him the questions?

*PAR:

Probably not. I probably should be asking __________.

*HV1: You're the math-minded teacher, not the English teacher.

*PAR:

I feel like I should ask more.

*HV1: So you help him be a good reader by asking questions; any other strategies?

*PAR:
reading strategy.

Work on pronunciation -- he struggles with a word but I don't know if that's a

*HV1: Absolutely. And I could ask you some specific prompts if you aren't sure. So what, if anything,
do you do to help him make time for reading?

*PAR:
One of the things I've gotten away from and have to reinstitute because it was
actually really effective was we just didn't have any screen time. So that included everything, unless he
needed something, he had a project or something for school but we just -- that was probably the most
effective thing was just eliminating that from the -- at least Monday through Thursday, and then we
have movie night on Friday. So ______ take that away.

*HV1: That's so sweet.

*PAR:
I think that was the most effective. And I think when I'm less stressed then I can
sit there and read with him, or we can parallel read, I guess.

*HV1: And it sounds like he really enjoys that.

*PAR:

Parallel play I guess with parallel reading.

*HV1: Number four: what if anything do you do when you see that he's having a hard time with a
book?

*PAR:
He does seem to do well with him unless he's having to read out loud to me.
That's one of the things we did for a long time was for him to read -- I read to you, you read to me, but
reading out loud is always harder, I think, it's harder for me. So if he's not reading out loud it's hard for
me to know what he's understanding unless we talked about it. That's one of the reasons we didn't
finish reading them -- so I have an idea what was going on instead of just being like, "Yeah, sure." You
can just -- _______________ fabulous because imagination is important. But when he's reading out
loud, trying to figure out just that he's tired or if it's because he's really struggling with the material
because he tends to read a lot of things that are not fiction. And he was reading a book on trains that he
has, and he didn't seem to have any problem with that, other than some of the words, and asking what
some of the things meant. But conceptually I don't think he was having any trouble with it but it was
also interesting to him.

*HV1: Which of course makes it easier. So if you were to see him struggling what would you do?

*PAR:
I guess just try and figure out what was going on by asking those questions -_____________________________ if he's struggling with what's being said or understanding or if he's
just flipping pages quickly it's hard -- because I think ______ a big reader and I stopped reading because I
got to being where people constantly wanted _____ to analyze the books and I don't like reading like
that. If I'm going to read I just want to be able to read.

*HV1: Not have to perform afterwards.

*PAR:
And I don't want to have to be like, "Well why do you think --?" [Whispering]
just an enjoyable thing to read. So that's a hard thing for me mind-wise.

*HV1: I understand. That resonates with me; I do understand that.

More specifically what are some questions that you ask Child C when you talk with him about
books that he has read?

*PAR:
Types of questions would be like why -- go back to _____________________
Percy Jackson we've been reading most recently is why do you think that happened or when he goes
back and he likes to compare things to real life or you'll hear him in real life saying, "Oh that's like so and
so," and we actually watched the first movie and that was --

*HV1: ____________ fun.

*PAR:

Yeah because the movie was terrible.

*HV1: Oh no.

*PAR:
It was so terrible. It was a terrible movie. It was a terrible movie anyhow but it
was really terrible because it was so -- and I think that was just really amazing -- which actually it was I
think one of the best experiences is to go, "See books are better than movies almost all the time." And
rarely do they even fall even keel.

*HV1: Approximate, yeah.

*PAR:
And that was actually a really rich experience for the fact that it was so bad. But
we tried to get those questions of why do you think that happened or is it similar to, or what would you
do in that situation? I mean it's hard because some of them are just so fanciful that it's hard to put
yourself in that position, but in thinking back about if it's a book that fantasy because a lot of the ____
series, what they'd do before when they were in a similar situation.

*HV1: Yeah, if you haven't read it it's hard to ask a lot of questions.

*PAR:
Yeah, so that's one of the reasons where we have to read together, I read ahead
because [whispering].

*HV1: So what, if anything, do you do to motivate him to read? I know you touched on this a little bit
before.

*PAR:

I think --

*HV1: (Home Visitor) asks them to go get books.

*PAR:
That's fine, he's like running up and down the -- that's why I didn't know if it
would be helpful because all his -- well not all his but most of his books are in there. I think what I _____
do, I mean he always gets books at Christmas and his birthday _______________ interested and we
always get some goofy things and he's gotten _________ books. I mean we always read and he's -- I
mean I guess he was always ______, or complimented as well, on his vocabulary, which I tend not to talk
to him like he's a little kid too often, and to have a more normal conversation. Try and get him books
he's interested in, you know, like when he was really into trains get him a train book, then he wants to
read it because he wants to -- and reading together because I think that together time is actually more
important for him than anything else. And then his former teacher -- I'm assuming it's _________
current teacher but his former teacher really, from earlier this year and second grade they really helped
him into reading and reading some really good books that _____ just the story lines are intriguing and --

*HV1: Helped find books that would pique his interest?

*PAR:
Mhm. I mean I know they were reading -- what is that series with the tree?
Magic Tree House. _______ we're going the Secrets of Droon which is nice because it's fairly simple

words and a reasonable good font size and they're slim so they're not overwhelming sometimes I think
those get overwhelming because they're kind of fat but they're not hard reading but they're kind of
meaty in that sense versus the skinny little, "Oh."

*HV1: Makes you feel like you've accomplished something, yeah.

*PAR:
And we started with the -- when he was first starting to read on his own was the
Captain Underpants because he's a boy and potty humor is always fun.

*HV1: Isn't it always? It still is in high school with your high school kids and you're just like --

*PAR:

Some of them it is, yeah.

*HV1: And are there other people in the home that help him with his reading?

*PAR:

My mom.

*HV1: And what does she do to help?

*PAR:

[Whispering]. She reads with him. She reads a lot.

*HV1: Clearly yes. And it's not just a bunch of hodge-podge books; they're all very attractive and
matching.

*PAR:

Yeah. And most of them are from the X Society.

*HV1: Is she in health care at X?

*PAR:
Yeah, she's a nurse ______, hence the scrubs. She's the kind of lady that would
read the dictionary happily. She's strange like that. I would not do that.

*HV1: I don't think most people would. And how interesting for her that her daughter came out on the
math side of things.

*PAR:
Oh she's analytical too. And I don't dislike reading it's just it got -- in middle
school when it was like you're reading The Red Badge of Courage or whatever you're reading they're like
"Analyze the scene. Why was this --?"

*HV1: It's almost like you miss the big picture because you're so fixated on not missing details for the
sake of testing and -- yeah.

*PAR:
And I just was like, "Can I just read the story and think about it and --?" When I
can read like that -- well I actually got a Kindle and I've been reading books because I moved in high
school so I didn't read a lot of like classic high school, like I never read The Scarlet Letter, which I'm not
saying it was ______________ a big miss by not reading but I feel like I should read these things. And
then my kids now they read -- from world lit they were reading a book and it sounds like a good book so
I borrowed it over Christmas break and read the book and like, "Okay. Now I can talk to you guys about
the book because I've read it," instead of looking at you and going -- "Can't help you. I'm sorry."

*HV1: How do you know if Child C has done a good job of reading a book?

*PAR:
I think when he can tell you about it, whatever that means. You can verify when
you're familiar with the book, but even -- I don't think too often you can not read a book and come up
with plausible things. Of course some of the fantasy things it's hard to tell but if you're reading about
imaginative you'd probably win there anyhow, but just having him tell me about it, what he's been
reading at school. Getting information from him about school is really hard. You can't just say, "What'd
you do in school today?" because the immediate answer is, "Nothing." "No, you did something." So I
try my best to be aware of what they're doing so I can try and ask more probing questions: "Oh, you're
studying geometry today. What did you learn about geometry?" Then when they were reading books
and he was reading -- which is one of the reasons why I try to parallel things at home or something
similar, even if it wasn't the book they were reading for school, get him books that they were reading for
the free reading time so that we could have any sort of conversation that wasn't just me making up
stuff.

*HV1: Yes, I understand. And what do you think makes a good third grade reader? In other words
what should a good third grade reader be able to do?

*PAR:

[Whispering]. No idea.

*HV1: I'm sure if I asked you what a third grader reader should be able to do in math you would know.

[Off mic conversation]

*PAR:
I really -- that's a really hard question; I'm not sure where they should be and I
know they have all the state standards. I would like to think that they can read on their own or
____________ and I don't know what an appropriate level book is, and that's why I've always gotten
guidance because I don't -- I want to get something that's challenging that makes him think or makes
him stretch but I don't want to get something that's over the top that you read it and you're just like,
"That makes no sense," and you remove the desire to read. If he can't read it really is very limiting to
everything else.

*HV1: That makes perfect sense.

*PAR:

Sorry, not a very good answer.

*HV1: No, everyone thinks they're supposed to be a third grade teacher to answer that question but
that's -- we're just wondering what do parents teach. So how do you describe his reading skills?

*PAR:
I would say they're okay. The teachers keep telling me he's a good reader, so
________ like I don't know what is appropriate from a developmental standpoint, and just in general I
don't know. And is that a comparison or is that something he should be able to -- I don't have a good
answer. I think he's a pretty good reader, ebb and flow. But I think when we're more consistent,
especially if we're reading one book and we're working right through it, I think that consistency really
helps him become more fluent.

*HV1: Okay.

*PAR:
And getting more comprehension instead of just feeling like he's speed reading
so he can say he read instead of actually reading it. And not to overanalyze but just your thinking, that
you're not just turning pages.

*HV1: And last question: what goals do you have for Child C's reading this summer?

*PAR:
I'd like to try to get him interested in different types of books and hopefully get
him reading more. Because he's got summer camp and that's so much fun that he frequently comes
home and is exhausted.

*HV1: Which camp?

*PAR:

(Camp X) with the YMCA here in (Town).

*HV1: They have such good summer stuff.

*PAR:
And it's outdoors and they fish and canoe and swim and their dirty nasty and it's
great fun. [Crosstalk]. And I look at the counselors -- and he's gone every year for the last three years
and some of the counselors have been the same. [Whispering].

*HV1: You have to have a certain level of stamina that I don't have. Kids are hard, younger ones.

*PAR:
And his camp goes from -- I think it might be Rising Kindergarteners, but it's
Rising First Graders all the way up to middle school and they have freshman and sophomores that are in
the counselors-in-training type program and the counselors are a lot of college students or just out of
college and some that are teachers __________________. _______ -- can't do that and it's too hot
outside and running around and keeping up with it and having to be silly and --

*HV1: Do you teach in the summertime too?

*PAR:
round school.

No. I get it off, so to speak. I'm almost wishing we didn't. I kind of like year-

*HV1: That's what my best friend who's a math teacher also says, she's like, "I would rather be in yearround any day than work that hard for 11 months and then get the two off."

*PAR:
Yeah, the year-round schools with -- not County ______ but here in (School)
where they do their nine weeks and then they're off for three, nine weeks, off for three -- you still get a
good winter break chunk, you still get a chunk in the summer. But I would think it would give the
teachers and the students just enough time to be like, "Whew." Because it's ______ stressful
__________.

*HV1: I understand that. Well those are all my questions for you. I think they're near the end.

*other excerpts from home visit*
And what are some of your favorite things to do with him?
*PAR: One of my favorite things, I like going -- we go to the Museum of Arts and Science, and that's
always fun. And going and watching his soccer games, or basketball, whatever. Or reading when he's
not ________.
*HV1: You said he almost likes being read to more.
*PAR: He really does, he wants to -- and I'm like, "I'm so tired, and I've got so much to do," and it puts
me to sleep and I have a hard time reading.

*From open-ended interview*

*HV1: So I want to know a little bit more about Child Y. And how are her routines, what she likes to
do, how’s her week when she is in school.

*PAR: Well, she is ___ ____ that all the children and her included, needs to read for at least one hour
every day. That’s what they do. Maybe Sundays sometimes they’re skipping when we go to church.
But the majority of the days they read at least an hour. Now her, she really likes to read. And whenever
she is pretty much having free time, especially during wintertime and everything, she just reads until
she’s done with books. She really likes it.

She also writes in her journal. Not every day, but ___ trying to, you know sometimes kids can
sometimes it’s a little bit shorter, a little bit just like ____ is for her and – but we’re trying to make her
write in her journal every day about the day and what she read or what happened in school. That’s also
dad’s idea.

*PAR2: Dad has a lot of ideas.

*PAR: Yeah.

*PAR2: So, I mean but there is a lot of reason behind it. Being able to recall information. Just being able
to –

*HV1: Reflect.

*PAR2: Yes. Exactly. And I think it also helps her to be more creative and think about things.

*PAR: And it also helps –

*HV1: That’s a really good thing.

*PAR: We’re not too – they’re not watching too much of TV. So it’s basically homework, reading and
then a little bit of free time, whatever they need to do, and then at the end of the day she’s writing in
her journal.

*HV1: And she is right now talking with Erica about what she reads and what she likes and everything.
Do you know a little bit about what is she interested in?

*PAR: Oh, my god, warriors.

*HV1: Warriors?

*PAR: _____ ____ warriors.

*PAR2: Yeah. I think she’s a lot interested in fantasy books. And I think she got a lot from her older
brother Child M, who reads a lot of that stuff as well. But right now I think it’s more fantasy than it is
anything else.

*HV1: Awesome. And how do you help her to become a better reader?

*PAR: Well, we ask her what is she reading. A lot of times it’s just pouring out of her. You don’t even
have to ask her.

*PAR2: Yeah. I think at this point when we establish the reading assignments for them to do, they all
basically just took it over from there. I don’t even have to ask them if they’ve read. So I think she reads
more for pleasure now than us really having to say, okay, well, what are you reading and are you
learning anything from it? Because she can recall – as a matter of fact, she’s a reading example in her
class. So.

*PAR: Yeah. And they also, because they’re more on each other’s levels then they read the same
books. She always exchanging experiences with her older brothers. They just, you know older brothers
also help to guide and influence what maybe she next can read or we’re going to the library and stuff
like that.

*PAR2: She’s definitely being challenged because she wants to read some of the same books that
they’re reading. Which automatically takes her to that next reading level so it really helps for Child M to
be an excellent reader and she’s kind of patterning behind him. So.

*HV1: If she ever has a problem reading, like a challenge, something that she is stuck on, what do you
suggest to her to overcome?

*PAR: She’s looking up things in the dictionary.

*PAR2: Well, yeah. Exactly. When she comes to a word in a book and she can’t understand it, the idea
is to go to the dictionary and find out what the definition is. And instead of skipping over it. Because
then that just takes whatever she’s just read to a layer of context. So the ideas is is that if you come
across a word that you don’t understand, you know pronounce it out loud. And then if you don’t
understand the meaning of the word, then look it up.

*HV1: Mm hmm. Okay. And do you ask questions to her about what is she reading and what kind of
questions do you ask?

*PAR2: I personally don’t think we need to ask questions because anything she reads she’s ready to tell
us about in some story form. Any time that I walk her to the bus stop, you know she’s always telling me
about a book or –

*PAR: Oh, we have night quiet time with her when I’m coming from work. Every night me and her,
we’re having quiet time. And she always tells about her day, what she read, what’s interesting. It’s just
like she’s very bubbly. She has a very happy, bubbly personality. And she’s just like, “Dad, guess what?”
He’s like, “What?”

*PAR2: Well, the other thing is that they also create characters around what they’ve read.

*PAR: And she’s also like trying to write her own books and stuff like that. She is trying to create her
own stories based on warriors. And it’s like you want to know why? No. La, la, la, la, la, la. And she’s
like she keeps going.

*HV1: If you will have the opportunity to advise other parents about how to motivate them to be great
readers, what would you say?

*PAR: Stop giving them too much of TV time. Read by example. Ask questions. Read with them. Give
them time.

*PAR2: I also think that it depends on the child itself. I think like Parent A had said, to lead by example,
and you do that by actually reading with the child. Have the child read to you. Because they you realize
that you’re interested in what they’re reading and what they’re doing. And then they’ll get more
enjoyment out of that. So I think that’s the first thing is to kind of build that relationship with them.

*PAR: This is how it’s started with her first; she found a book that she really loved. This is how
basically their relationship started. He actually gave her this book as a gift. And they kind of – we were
using this book as an example of exciting situations and stories. And they created a whole different
story out of that story. It was kind of fun. And this is how she kind of got into – and I mean books that
you give your child needs to be interesting and to their level also.

*Open-ended interview*
*HV1: Okay. We are done with the first half, the other part, um, I repeat, there are no right or wrong
questions [sic] and I won’t take notes, it is open questions, you talk as much as you want.
[0:10:0] Um, so we’ll start the second part. We are interested in knowing what you and Child G do in
your daily routines. Please tell me as much as you can remember about Child G’s routine from the time
he wakes up until he goes to bed.
*PAR1 F: A typical day?
*HV1: A typical day, from the moment he wakes up until he goes to bed.
*PAR1 F: For example, when he goes to school or when he is home?
[0:11:01]
*HV1: A typical day, let’s say, let’s say today.
*PAR1 F: Today. In the morning he goes to school, he comes back from school, eats something, then
goes out to play with his friends, comes back to bathe, eats again, and goes to bed around ten. Uh-huh.
[0:11:30]
*HV1: Okay. We are also interested in learning about Child G’s books, the books he has, and his reading
interests. Child G is now showing Erika [ph] some books. Where did Child G get most of his books?
*PAR1 F: We have bought some, others he bought at school, others he got from his friends, or
[0:12:05]
*HV1: From school you mean from the school library?
*PAR1 F: No, from what they call the book fair.
*HV1: Book fair?
*PAR1 F: Uh-huh, the book fair, he got them there.
*HV1: The school book fair.
*PAR1 F: Uh-huh.
*HV1: Where else?
*PAR1 F: Others
*HV1: You said from friends?
*PAR1 F: Uh-huh, some were given by friends
*HV1: A friend gave it to him.

[0:12:32]
*PAR1 F: Uh-huh. Yes. And others we bought them, and like that.
*HV1: And you have bought others for him.
*PAR1 F: Uh-huh.
*HV1: So some from the book fair, others were given by friends, and you have bought the others.
*PAR1 F: Uh-huh.
*HV1: Okay. And what are some of the things you do for him to become a good reader?
[0:13:04]
*PAR1 F: What I do?
*HV1: Uh-huh.
*PAR1 F: Well, honestly, not too much. Not much really, and that is what I think. For him to read, we
have to be on top of him, tell him, “Come on, let’s read, sit down and read”, because if not he won’t
read. He says he doesn’t like it, he doesn’t like to read. The teacher told me that, “Yes, he doesn’t like to
read”. There are books he likes, like the ones about hurricanes, tornadoes, and those we pick them at
the bookstore [sic]. [0:13:35] And some others he likes a bit more is what we sometimes get from the
bookstore [sic]. But yes, it is hard for him, he says he doesn’t like it. He doesn’t like it, period.
*HV1: You do something so he has time to read?
[0:14:05]
*PAR1 F: Only, like I told you, not every day but sometimes, for example he plays, comes home and eats,
and before bedtime we read a bit. Uh-huh.
*HV1: You do something so he learns the meaning of new words?
[0:14:29]
*PAR1 F: Yes, when he doesn’t understand I try to explain what it means. Uh-huh.
*HV1: Like for example?
*PAR1 F: For example, um, uh, how can I say it? Um, well sometimes he’ll ask anything, like uh, um…
Well, besides… related to books, well he tries to understand it when we read books that I read or he
reads, um, but words that we… that are written in a different way, that is when he gets confused, and
that is when we explain him that it is the same but written differently.
[0:15:28]
*HV1: What do you do, if anything, when he has difficulties reading a book?
*PAR1 F: What did you say?
*HV1: What do you do, if anything, when he has difficulties reading a book when he reads a book

*PAR1 F: What he does
*HV1: No, you.
*PAR1 F: or what we do? Um, when he reads and reads fast and, well, I don’t know much English, so,
but, we try to pronounce more or less the let the words. And when we read in Spanish it is more, more
better [sic] [0:16:07] Because that way we can help him better. Uh-huh.
*HV1: And what are some of the questions you ask Child G when you talk about books he has read?
*PAR1 F: Um, what was the book about, and what happened at the beginning, later and at the end.
[0:16:32]
*HV1: Okay. And what do you do, if anything, to motivate him to read?
*PAR1 F: Um, as I told you, he says doesn’t like it, but I tell him, but we have to do it because you need
to… and he says, well, you read, and I tell him, no, you read, because you are the one who needs to
learn for school. Uh-huh.
[0:17:02]
*HV1: Are there other people at home who help him read?
*PAR1 F: No, just me.
*HV1: Only you.
*PAR1 F: Uh-huh.
*HV1: How would you describe Child G’s reading skills?
*PAR1 F: Like from one to five, one to ten, or how? Or little, medium
[0:17:31]
*HV1: As you, as you wish.
*PAR1 F: What can I tell you? Um, medium.
*HV1: More or less.
*PAR1 F: More or less.
*HV1: And what is your method for his reading in summer?
[0:17:54]
*PAR1 F: Well, I would like… or even maybe summer schools that could help him with reading, now that
he is going to the fourth [sic]. Um, put him in a, um, summer school. Uh-huh.
*HV1: How do you know if he’s done a good job reading a book?
*PAR1 F: How do I know?

*HV1: Uh-huh.
*PAR1 F: Well, like when I read, and if he read, I ask him what the book was about. Uh-huh.
[0:18:35]
*HV1: You ask him questions.
*PAR1 F: Uh-huh. I ask him questions.
*HV1: Okay. Well, this was our part. Now he is reading… or he finished. [0:18:58] So the last part of this
interv of this visit is an activity we will do together, with Child G.


01-ANP

*HV1: I get it. All right, very nice. So we’re done with those questions and now we get to some of the
more fun questions, I think. So tell me a little bit about Child Z’s kind of daily schedule. Start with when
she wakes up in the morning. What’s her typical routine?

*PAR: Her typical routine is to fight me in the morning because she doesn’t want to get up. She puts
her clothes on. She goes to her grandma. I drop something off at her grandmother’s house and then
she goes to school.

*HV1: Does she take the bus to school from her grandmother’s?

*PAR: No. Her grandmother drives her.

*HV1: Nice. So after school, what’s kind of y’all’s routine?

*PAR: Some days she goes to J.E. Boys’ and Girls’ Club and some days I pick her up. Nine times out of
ten, she’s going to Boys’ and Girls’ Club.

*HV1: Does she like that?

*PAR: Sometimes she does and sometimes she don’t.

*HV1: Do you know what they do at the club, usually?

*PAR: Well, lately they’ve been going on field trips. They went to the recycling place to learn how to
make things out of recycling. They do their homework. If they need tutoring, they have tutoring, and
they mostly play dodge ball or soccer outside.

*HV1: Very fun. Let me get back to my questions. So we’re interested in learning more about Child Z’s
books and what she’s interested in reading ‘cause we’re hoping to send books that she’s actually
interested in instead of just books on their own. So right now, Child Z’s showing (Home Visitor) some of

her books that she has and books that she likes. So where would you say Child Z gets most of her books
from?

*PAR: Her grandmother and her aunts.

*HV1: You mentioned you guys go to the library? Usually how many books does she –

*PAR: As many as she could possibly try to check out. At the end, it’s like, “Mom, I’m ready to go back.
I need some more.”

*HV1: Very nice. So what are some things that you do to help Child Z become a better reader?

*PAR: If she don’t know the word, between me and my mom, we make her write the word down and
then go to the dictionary and write the definition out so she’ll know what the word is and the meaning
of the word in case she come across it again.

*HV1: Very nice. Is there anything else that you do to help her become a better reader?

*PAR: I try to make her read every day to build her reading skills up.

*HV1: Very good. So what do you do when Child Z has a hard time reading a book, like she pulls a book
off the shelf and she’s like, “This is too hard for me.”

*PAR: I tell her to take her time. There’s gonna be more books that she’s not gonna be able to read
but she just has to get through it. I try to help her as much as I can.

*HV1: So what are some questions that you ask when you’re talking about a book that she read?

*PAR: Does she understand? Does she know there’s an ending, a beginning? Can you tell me the plot
of the story? Can you tell me what’s going on in the story? Can you tell me any characters of the story?

*HV1: So is there anything that you do to make Child Z want to read more often?

*PAR: No, not really, because I’m into romance novels so I can’t – I don’t know what the kids are
reading ‘cause I’m not into what the kids are doing. I’m just worried about the time that I’m with the
kids.

*HV1: So tell me more about these novels that you read?

*PAR: I like Sister Sober and Conway and I’m reading the book now that’s on the chair. I just like the
black authors. I don’t know if they’re good books or like that’s what I’m into, those type of books.

*HV1: So does Child Z ever read any of those –

*PAR: No.

*HV1: I haven’t ever read Sister Sober. I’ll have to read that.

*PAR: Yeah, _____ _____ _____. Have you ever read it?

*HV1: No.

*PAR: It’s a good book.

*HV1: Well, I love that you love those. That’s great. So are there other people in your home that read
with Child Z or that she reads to?

*PAR: Unh-unh. I think she reads at her dad’s when she goes down there. She reads with her sister.

*HV1: Is her sister older or younger?

*PAR: Older.

*HV1: Older.

*PAR: Yeah, she’s in middle school.

*HV1: So how do you know if Child Z has done a good job reading a book?

*PAR: ‘Cause I will ask her about the book and if she can’t tell me, I know she hasn’t done a good job
because she can’t go back and explain it to me.

*HV1: So what do you think makes a good third-grade reader? What should a good third-grade reader
be able to do, in your opinion?

*PAR: They should be able to read chapter books by then instead of the _____ _____ _____.

*HV1: Okay, so not like that, so something that’s thicker than that?

*PAR: Mm-hmm.

*HV1: Anything else a third-grader should be able to do?

*PAR: They should be able to identify what they’re reading and the age for it.

*HV1: Can you tell me more about that? What would that look like if they identified what they were
reading?

*PAR: Like that Diary of a Wimpy Kid. I guess the child is in school and he’s writing a diary about
what’s going on in his life and it’s like grade school. So they can identify with situations that’s going on
in the book. They might have trouble in school.

*HV1: So how would you describe Child Z’s reading skills?

*PAR: I’d say average.

*HV1: Is there anything that she’s particularly good at doing or would read?

*PAR: I can say she brought her reading up this year because we were struggling at the beginning with
her language and she went from a D to a B, so I was proud of her.

*HV1: Wow. Well, that’s a testament to what you’re doing, too. That’s really good.

*PAR: She don’t want to be back in third grade.

*HV1: So what goals do you have for Child Z’s reading this summer? Do you have any things that you
would like her to do?

*PAR: I want her to read as many books as possible because where you get your knowledge from is the
books. I wish I would have had somebody tell me in third grade, “Just read. Just read.”

*HV1: I know, it’s fun. It’s really fun.

*PAR: If I’m really into a book, it will take me about two days to read the book. I would stay up and
Child Z’s like, “Mom, you still up?” “Yeah, you go to sleep.”

*HV1: I know. I love when you find a book like that that you just want to keep reading. Very nice.
Well, thank you so much for talking with me today. This has been so wonderful and informative. I’ve
learned a lot. So I think we’re going to go back in and talk a little bit more with both of you two.


01-AGV
*Open-ended interview*

*HV1: So we are interested in knowing about the kinds of things that you guys do, like on your
everyday routine. So can you tell me just like, Child J wakes up at what time, like a basic routine from
waking up to bed time.

*PAR: Okay, so I normally get them up at 6:30, and then they’ll brush their teeth and make up their
bed and I’ll iron while they are doing all that and then they’ll get dressed, they’ll be getting dressed.
They normally get their snacks. He warms up my car at like 6:45.

*HV1: Oh gosh.

*PAR: She does it sometimes, but he does it more of the time.

*HV1: Very nice.

*PAR: And then like they’ll probably play the game, well, I don’t know if she plays it, I don’t think she
does. But he’ll play the game for probably like 30 minutes before we leave and then I’ll take her to
school. On a good day, like 7:20. And then, he’ll get to school like 7:30, 7:40 something like that. I have
been having a lot of overtime, but on a normal day I get off at 6:00 and so I’ll come and pick her up. I’ll
probably get here like 6:20 and she does her homework while I’m at work. Like I’ll talk to her on my
break and check on her to see how her homework is.

And he goes to his dad’s house. So he does his homework over there. So I’ll pick her up.

*HV1: Is she still at school? Does she stay at school till 6:

*PAR: No, she catch the bus.

*HV1: Okay, okay.

*PAR: So she’s here till 6:00. Most days she’s here till 6:00 unless like my mom is off or she gets off at
3:00 and then she’ll go to my mom’s house till 6:00. It just depends on how the schedules are. Then I’ll
pick him up and then we’ll get here and I’ll talk to them about their day, how was their day. They’ll ask
me about my day. And I’ll cook, they take a shower like 7:00. And then we’ll eat probably like 7:30,
normally, when I’m done cooking.

*HV1: No, don’t let me burn your—

*PAR: I ___ so it’s going to be a while.

*HV1: Oh my gosh. That sounds good.

*PAR: So probably like 7:30 we’ll eat and then maybe like 8:00 they’ll go take a shower and then, um,
we’ll either make something like sometimes we’ll bake some stuff, like we make rice crispy treats.
We’ve made brownies, we’ve made cookies. Whatever we think to make. You know, we normally go to
the grocery store like twice a week so we’ll get something to make. If we don’t make anything it
depends on what day it is. Like Mondays and Sundays I’m on my shows so hard, or he’s like playing the
game and then, or they’ll go outside with their neighbors. My neighbors, whatever activity it is done by
8:30 and then I don’t know it just seems like time just goes, but they go to bed at 9:30, so they are in
bed by 9:30 every day.

So it depends on what else needs to be done in between that time.

*HV1: Yeah, great. One question that I skipped over earlier that I want to make sure I get too. What
would you say one of Child J favorite books is?

*PAR:

None.

*HV1:

Okay.

*PAR: He really don’t like to read at all. It’s like if you tell him to read, he feels like he’s on
punishment. Like he really don’t like it real bad, like.

*HV1: Yeah. So (Home Visitor) has been asking him some questions about the books that he has and
the books that he likes, so what where would you say Child J gets most of his books from?

*PAR: Barnes and Nobles.

*HV1: Barnes and Noble. Okay, good, so what are some things that you do to help Child J become a
better reader?

*PAR: I don’t know. I think I kind of hinder him a little bit because he is very spoiled, like real bad, so if
I asked him to read something and he’s like you know, complained or whatever, I will be like watching
the clock, like you only have a few more minutes, you only have a few more minutes. And then, once
the time is up, I’m like, okay you can stop. All right, what was the book about and he’ll make up
whatever and then I’ll read it and I’ll basically tell him really and I don’t really think that I really help him
in any way, but I do want him to read, but I don’t want him to feel like he’s being punished.

You know what I mean? So I don’t know. I know I’m not helping him with it.

*HV1: So what, if anything do you do when Child J has a hard time? You kind of touched on that a little
bit, but when he’s having just a really hard time with a book, what are some of your responses? Like—

*PAR: I’ll read it and I’ll go back over it with him and I’ll ask him to read it again. And it’s like, I don’t
know if he’s just not trying to understand what’s happening or he just really don’t, or he just want it to
be over, I don’t know, but I just end up just like telling him and he’s like oh, yeah, yeah, I remember, but
I don’t know if he remembers or it’s just ‘cause I just said it. You know. So I don’t know. I really don’t
know how I am helping him.

*HV1: What about, are there any questions that you ask like after he reads or while he reads to find
out?

*PAR: Yeah, I’ll ask him like okay, who is the characters in the first chapter or whatever. And you
know, he’ll tell me most of the people and what they are doing is like out the window. Like he’ll give me
little jist that makes sense, sometimes it’s just like, well, they were doing this and I don’t remember.

*HV1: Um-hum.

*PAR: Child J, what are you doing?

*HV1: However he wants to read it, that’s right.

*PAR: So is there anything that you do that makes Child J want to read more?

*HV1: Have you ever come across anything that just really motivates him to want to read?

*PAR: No, like he sees me read all the time, but he says I read because I don’t have nothing else to do.
Like, he’s like because mom, you don’t really have anything to do, like I want to go outside. I want to
play. He really thinks it’s from boredom, I think. I don’t read because I’m bored, but he thinks so.

*HV1: So that’s one thing that you do though, to help motivate him to help show him that you enjoy
reading and that-, nice. That’s great. Love that. Love that, thank you so much for talking with me
tonight. This has been really informative. Hopefully, we’ll get some good books for Child J to read this
summer.

*PAR: Yeah, I think he’ll like more stuff that’s funny because he likes to laugh and joke and stuff. I’m
like—

*HV1: Humorous?

*PAR: Yeah.

*HV1: I’ll make a note of that, humorous books.

*PAR: Or something about sports. Maybe he could stick to that.

*HV1: ‘Cause basketball particularly is one of his—

*PAR: Yeah, he’s a Carolina fan, he loves college basketball.


01_ADH
[0:00:55]Um, I would like to know, um, how a normal day looks like for your daughter, what is her
routine when she is in school, from morning until the afternoon, how is her day: at what time she wakes
up, eats, leaves, comes back.

PAR: Well, uh… For example, in the morning I wake her up at around 7:00 or 7:30 while she gets ready
to go to school. And she doesn’t like to have breakfast at home, she likes to have breakfast at school.
And then she leaves. She goes to school. And then I go to work. And when I get back, I’m home when
she comes back.
[0:01:58] And after her classes, she comes back, um, sometimes she’ll be hungry, sometimes not. And if
she wants eat something, that’s OK, but later she’ll have dinner. And if she is not hungry, during that
time I help her with her homework, although I can’t help her very much, but I do what I can.
[0:02:23] And afterwards I take her out for a while. And then we go back inside and give them a bath,
and dinner. Then they watch some TV, and then they go to bed.

HV1: They watch some TV and then go to bed. OK. And the books that you see they know, where do you
get them from, where do you bring them from, what kind of books are they, which ones does she like to
read?
[0:02:48]
PAR: The books she brings are school books.
HV1: School books?
PAR: I don’t know the titles, because [laughter]… books from school, and last year they also gave me
some books that she was reading, some of them, by herself.
[0:03:08]
HV1: What do you think about your daughter being a good reader?
PAR: Because she likes it. She became interested in books on her own.
HV1: And what things do you do to help her?
PAR: Like what?
HV1: I don’t know, like motivate her, or…
PAR: Umm, to motivate her…
HV1: If you don’t do anything else, that’s ok.
[0:03:36]

PAR: Since sometimes we go to the park, like we don’t have any other place to go, sometimes we go
walking, sometimes we go with my husband where he goes to play, and that.
HV1: And well, if she has difficulty reading a book, do you notice it? Have you done anything to help her
when she gets stuck reading something?
PAR: I don’t know, because since I don’t understand much English, I speak Spanish and another dialect,
what I see is that she is reading, I believe she is reading, but I don’t know if she is pronouncing it
correctly.
[0:04:18]
HV1: And, do you ask her questions about what she is reading?
PAR: Sometimes I ask her, what did you read? And that is the question I ask her, and then she tells me
what she read in the book.
HV1: Do you do something to motivate her to read a lot?
PAR: I just tell her to read for about 30 minutes, I tell that to all my kids, read for about 30 minutes, a
minimum of 30 minutes.
[0:04:45]
HV1: Are there other people at home besides you that help them to read?
PAR: Um, no.
HV1: And how do you know if your son or daughter has done a good job when he/she read a book?
PAR: What… how do I…?
HV1: How do you realize if she really read it well… when she reads?
PAR: Because she tells me what she read. And she says, this thing happened here, or this other thing
happened here. So then I think that she understood what she read.
[0:05:21]
HV1: What is Child E’s birth date?
PAR: (X)
HV1: Tell me a little bit what kind of girl is Child E, what she likes, what she does…
PAR: Well, she…
HV1: …what does she dream about…
PAR: She, um, she is, she was very shy since she was a baby, very shy. Wherever you put her, she stayed
there (laughter) for a long time, and she didn’t cry at all until this day. She, I think she is the sweetest
girl. She is a girl who also likes to help.
[0:06:07]

HV1: Uh-huh?
PAR: Uh-huh.
HV1: Oh, how nice. Tell me about her favorite activities, what she likes to do.
PAR: What she likes to do?
HV1: Uh-huh. What she enjoys the most.
PAR: Well, I don’t know… I don’t think it is playing, because I don’t think she likes games or watching TV
too much, because what she likes the most is walking and playing with other kids. For example, my
sister in law started selling some things, and she, well I think she likes it, because she tells me, I’m going
with her to sell her things.
[0:06:48]
HV1: Uh-huh.
PAR: Uh-huh. Because she wants to walk
HV1: (overlapping) to walk, to go out.
PAR: Uh-huh.
HV1: What are some of the favorite activities that you do with her?
PAR: Well, since we are home now, at this moment we aren’t doing anything.
HV1: When you are with her in your spare time, on weekends, when she has no homework to do, what
do you enjoy together the most?
[0:07:19]
PAR: Well, she likes to go on the water. We took her once. She also loves to go and watch things.


01-BFB
HV1: One of the things we are interested in learning about you and Child Y is about your daily routines.
Okay? Please tell me, as much as you can remember, about a typical day for Child Y from the moment
she wakes up until she goes to bed.
PAR: Excuse me, what did you say?
[0:10:05]
HV1: If you can tell me, as much as you can remember, about a typical day for Child Y, from the moment
she wakes up until she goes to bed.
PAR: So just like
HV1: The daily routine
PAR: The daily routine.
HV1: from the… She does this, and this, and that…
PAR: Well, as you see, since she goes to school, she wakes up, brushes her teeth and combs her hair.
When she is ready she tells me, “Mom, let’s go”. Um, that is her daily routine.
[0:10:40]
HV1: Uh-huh, and then?
PAR: Uh-huh, and then when she gets home from school she tells me, “Mom, I want to eat”. And that is
also part of her daily routine. And then, as I told you, I take her out to play for a while. And in the
afternoon, that’s all. Then she comes, takes a bath, watches TV for a while and goes to bed.
[0:11:08]
HV1: Another thing we are interested in learning is what kinds of books she likes to read. She is showing
(home visitor) some of her books. Where did she get most of her books?
PAR: Well, they gave her those books at school. Those books she has they just gave her at school. And
HV1: They gave them to her, or are they from the library?
PAR: No, they gave them to her at school.
HV1: Uh, okay.
PAR: Uh-huh. They gave her like six or eight books. They gave them to her.
[0:11:45]
HV1: From somewhere else too, or
PAR: What?
HV1: From somewhere else… the book she has, or ?

PAR: From school, and sometimes I buy her books, like… we go out to, like to the garais[sic] , sometimes
I bring her books from
HV1: The garage sales?
PAR: Uh-huh.
HV1: Or yard sales.
PAR: Yard sales.
HV1: Yard sales.
PAR: Uh-huh. I find them there and I bring her books.
[0:12:29]
HV1: What are some of the things you do to make her a better… a good reader?
PAR: Like for her to be a good reader? Well, I motivate her to pay attention in school so she can move
forward and so she doesn’t flunk, I encourage her a lot to pay attention and to work hard to ace her
tests, now that she just had a test. Uh-huh.
[0:13:03]
HV1: What do you do to help her, for example, to have time to read?
PAR: To have time to read? Well
HV1: If you do anything.
PAR: What?
HV1: If you do anything.
PAR: No, as I told you, she gets out of school at four and she has time to do her homework, and when
she finishes her homework she reads her books if she has time to read the books.
[0:13:38]
HV1: What do you do, if anything, for her to learn the meaning of new words?
PAR: Um, new words? Well, I tell her to pay a lot of attention to learn new words, and then I start telling
her what new words she has to say. Because she understands very little Spanish. Uh-huh. And then I
teach her to say the new words she should say.
[0:14:19]
HV1: Do you do anything to help her read new words better?
PAR: Well, yes. I do help her.
HV1: What do you do?
HV1: Well. For example, I grab a book with things in Spanish and I start reading to her. Uh-huh.

[0:14:48]
HV1: If you do something, what do you do to help her understand what she reads?
PAR: If she doesn’t understand what I am reading to her, she asks me and then I explain it to her what it
says. Uh-huh.
HV1: What do you do when she has difficulties reading a book?
PAR: Uh… together. I tell her if she doesn’t understand what she reads, we will read it together. And
then she reads with me. Uh-huh.
[0:15:22]
HV1: And what is one of the questions you ask her when you talk with her about books?
PAR: These books that she reads or the ones I showed you?
HV1: No, any books she reads in general.
PAR: Well, when she reads her books I ask her and she starts explaining what it is about, about a teacher
and another teacher, and the book said one was good and the other was bad, she was a witch
HIV: (laughter)
[0:16:01]
PAR: and that the witch made them work hard, and she didn’t feed them, and the children cried. That’s
what I asked her about it.
PAR: And what do you do to motivate her to read?
PAR: Well, I motivate her to read so in the future she becomes a teacher, because she says when she
grows up she wants to be a teacher.
HV1: Uh-huh.
PAR: Uh-huh.
HV1: What do you do, do you do any specific thing to help her?
[0:16:31]
PAR: Yes, well, I tell her to learn to read so he learns and moves forward so she knows all the book says.
Uh-huh.
HV1: Is there anyone else in the house to help her read?
[0:16:57]
PAR: No.
HV1: Just you.
PAR: Just me.

(rustling papers)
HV1: How do you know if Child Y has done a good job reading a book?
PAR: Because they always give her diplomas at school and she shows them to me, the diplomas they
give her for… that say that she reads very well. Uh-huh.
[0:17:30]
HV1: How would you describe her reading abilities?
PAR: What?
HV1: How would you describe her reading abilities?
PAR: Um… good, very good. Yes.
HV1: Could you give me an example, something specific?
PAR: Um, well, I like her behavior in school, because always when I go to school her teacher always tells
me a lot about her, that she does excellent in school. Uh-huh.
[0:18:09]
HV1: What are your goals for Child Y this summer regarding reading?
PAR: Well, that she learns more and to move forward so she learns to read better.
HV1: Well, that’s all.
PAR: Yes.
HV1: Now we will have the conversation together jointly with her.
[0:18:38]
PAR: Uh-huh.
HV1: This is yours, as not to confuse you.
(long silence)
[0:19:26]
HV1: (to CHI and HV2) Are you guys ready? Okay.


01-BAF

*HV1: Okay. So we’re interested in knowing the kinds of things you and your third-grader do in your
everyday routine. So tell me about a typical day for Child M, from morning to bedtime, as well as you
can remember.

*PAR: Okay. She’s definitely not a morning person. Definitely not a morning person. So on a school
day, we usually get up, have breakfast and prepare for school. I usually drop her off at school. Go to
work. Pick her up around 5:00-ish in the evening.

If she has homework, we’ll usually do our homework after dinner. And normally, if she doesn’t have to
read for school, I’ll have her read for 30 minutes on her own. But if she is having to read for school, then
I won’t make her read anymore.

*HV1: Uh-huh.

*PAR: Normally, after all homework is done and reading is done, she can watch TV – usually, I’d say,
between an hour and an hour and a half, depending on what the homework is like. Prepare for bed.
And then she’s usually in the bed by 9:00.

*HV1: Okay. And we’re interested in learning more about your child’s books and reading interests. So
right now, Child M’s in there showing (Home Visitor) some books.

So where did you get most of her books from? So would you say the school library? Public library? Did
you buy them? Did someone else give them to her? Or did the school give them to her?

*PAR: Most of her books that she has, I’ve bought. I’ve bought quite a few through their book fairs.

*HV1: Uh-huh.

*PAR: I usually kind of load up when they have book fairs.

*HV1: Okay.

*PAR: And then kind of different stores, if we’re out and about, and something has come out that she
wants. Then if we see it, we’ll get it from the store.

*HV1: So you would say you’ve bought most of them?

*PAR: Uh-huh.

*HV1: Okay. What are some things you do to help your child become a good reader?

*PAR: I think the most important thing is having her read on a consistent and regular basis. And I try to
emphasize how important – because sometimes I know she’s got to read for school, and then I make her
read at home. So she can get kind of burnt out from having to read.

But I just try to stress the importance of reading. And when I make her read, I usually let her read what
she wants to read, so she’s able to choose what – so she’s able to have a say in what she’s reading, and
hopefully she’ll get more enjoyment.

*HV1: Right. Okay. What, if anything, do you do when your child has a hard time with a book?

*PAR: Usually, if she has questions about words, maybe what certain words mean or how to
pronounce something, she’ll ask me. So we’ll talk about what something means.

Since she’s picking out the books, she’s pretty good about picking things out that are kind of right on par
with where she is.

*HV1: Right.

*PAR: If she’s having a hard time with something, I definitely try to encourage her to kind of push
through. And I would be a little bit more hands-on, as far as sitting down with her as she’s reading, if I
find she’s having difficulty.

*HV1: Okay. And what are some questions that you ask your child when you talk about books that she
has read?

*PAR: So we talk about who the characters are in the book. We talk about what has happened. We
sometimes relate things from what she reads to things she may have experienced.

*HV1: Uh-huh.

*PAR: I think that’s pretty much it, as far as how we kind of break a book down.

*HV1: And what, if anything, do you do to motivate your child to read?

*PAR: Over the summers, she participates in the summer reading with the County Library.

*HV1: Okay.

*PAR: So they get treats for turning in their calendars that show that they have read.

*HV1: Right. Okay. Are there other people in your home that help your child with reading?

*PAR: No.

*HV1: And how do you know if your child has done a good job reading a book?

*PAR: I can usually tell from our discussions. A lot of times, I don’t have to necessarily ask her about a
book she’s reading. She’ll tell me about something that happened.

*HV1: Okay. And what makes a good third grade reader?

*PAR: I think just consistency in reading, just really reading. I know at school, they kind of push them
to read. Because it’s really important that they read. I think also having a parent that reads.

And I enjoy reading myself. So when I make her read, I'm not making her do something that she’s no
seeing me do.

*HV1: Right. Right. Right. And what should a good reader be able to do?

*PAR: Should be able to read with fluency. Should also, when they come to a word that maybe they’ve
not seen before, haven’t been exposed to – being able to sound it out, and using context clues to kind of
figure out what the meanings of words are.

*HV1: Okay. And how would you describe your child’s reading skills?

*PAR: I would definitely describe her as a very fluent reader.

*HV1: And what goals do you have for your child’s reading this summer?

*PAR: I hope to continue our five days a week. We were actually just talking about that in the grocery
store.

*HV1: Okay.

*PAR: Like next week, I’ll give her a week off. You know? Trying to break it up a little bit. But just
consistently do it. It’s so important – especially over the summer, since they’re not really doing anything
academic, to just try to read and – I don't know.

Maybe I’ll figure out some things we can do as a reward, once she meets certain goals.

*HV1: Right. Okay. That’s all the questions. We’re just gonna wait for them to finish up.


01-AAQ
*From open-ended interview

*HV1: The first question is, “We’re interested in knowing what kinds of things you and Child K, your
third grader, do in your everyday routines. Tell me about a typical day for Child K, from morning to
bedtime, as well as you can remember.”

*PAR: Okay, morning. We get up at 5:00. Yeah.

*HV1: Whoa.

*PAR: Get dressed, out the door by 6:30. They go to my sister’s house to get ready for school. They
get on the bus about 7:45, 8:00 and they start their school day. They come home from school at about
4:00. They come in, do homework, do their reading. Then they go outside and run around and play
because most kids nowadays, they come in and go play video games. No. “Go outside.”

[Laughter]

Like the old days. “Don’t come back in. Go outside.” They run around and play until about
6:00, 6:30. They come home. We may have time to get something to eat, time to go to church, go
there, come back home, take showers, go to bed. That’s about every day except on the weekends,
when they’re running off somewhere to go do something. We rarely are ever in the house.

*HV1: We’re interested in learning more about your child’s reading interests. Child K’s showing (Home
Visitor) some books right now. Where does she get most of her books from?

*PAR: Friends, school. A lot come from school when she checks them out in the library.

*HV1: The school library, you mean?

*PAR: Yes. When we’re out in the store or something, she’ll see something interesting. I’ll go ahead
and pick it up, or book fairs. They hit the book fairs and they hit them hard. They’ll get five or six books
and they commits to reading them all between her and her sister because her sister’s on a higher

reading level than her. But she reads some of the books that she gets, so they’re constantly doing the
book swap.

*HV1: Okay. What are some of the things that you do to help Child K become a good reader?

*PAR: I push them. I challenge them, and as far as reading in school and stuff, they’re not required to
read every day, but I make her read every day. I buy them challenging books on things that they are
interested in to make sure that they are challenging themselves to learn, y'know? Progress themselves
in reading and put themselves on a higher level. Get them something they’re interested in. You buy
books that you don’t want to read, you’re going to look at them like, “Meh. I’ll pass,” and keep on
going. So I let them pick out what they like to read instead of stuff that I think they should be reading.

*HV1: Do you do anything to help her learn the meanings of new words?

*PAR: Yes. We always have a dictionary somewhere around here, and especially when you’re in the
process of reading, “I don’t know this word.” “Go get the dictionary and look it up.” “Oh, that’s what
that meant.” “Yeah. The dictionary is a good book.”

[Laughter]

So every time I catch them in the dictionary just looking at stuff, “Want to know new vocabulary
words? It’s a book about this thick, full of them. Go for it.”

[Laughter]

*HV1: What do you do, if anything, to help her understand what she reads?

*PAR: When she has questions, I try to help her as best I can with questions that she has about things
she’s reading. She’ll get to, maybe, a point in a story and doesn’t understand what a certain word
means or what’s actually happening. I’m like, “Well, go back and read what happened before and then
read past what you don’t understand and you’ll get an understanding of what’s going on in the middle.
And if you still don’t understand, we’ll break it down and figure out what’s going on.”

*HV1: What do you do, if anything, when she has a hard time with a book?

*PAR: Again, we’ll pull the dictionary out because if you don’t know a word we’ll look it up, see what it
means and use it in context of what she’s actually reading. Again, going back to reading what you read
before and see where it falls into context of what you’re reading now, and also looking forward and then
going back. That’s all in the process of comprehension and I’m trying to push that on them because it’s
very looked upon, especially at the end of the school year and the grade testing. This is her first year
doing EOGs. It’s very stressful for both of us.

*HV1: Okay. What kind of test is that?

*PAR: EOGs. It’s End-of-Grade Testing. Yeah. This is her first year doing EOGs and she’s like, “I don’t
want to fail. I don’t want to fail. I gotta read. I gotta understand this.” Like, “Just calm down. It’s not
that serious. You’ve been passing all year. You’re going to be pass your EOG.”

[Laughter]

*HV1: What are some of the questions that you ask Child K when you talk about books that she’s read?

*PAR: “What did you read? What’s the title of your book? Some of the characters in the book? What
are the characters like? What’s going on in the story? Do you like this book?” If she can understand all
of that, then I know that she knows what she’s reading.

*HV1: What, if anything, do you do to motivate your child, Child K, to read?

*PAR: They like doing fun activities on the weekend. If you read, you get rewarded. It’s a good
system, in a sense, but in the end they still both benefit on each end. They get something fun to do,
they get to run around and have fun with their friends, but they still get the benefit of actually doing the
reading and progressing in school. And that’s what has pushed them to the level that they are now.
Both of my kids are straight-A students and I’m not going to say, “I request it.” I demand it. There’s no
reason why you should not have straight-As in school. You have all the resources available to you and
it’s given to you on a silver platter, so you should take full advantage. So take full advantage. You will
get rewarded.

*HV1: Are there other people in your home to help Child K in reading?

*PAR: Not in my home, but my sister because if they’re not here, they’re at my sister’s house. And she
has kids their age and we all do our part to make sure everybody is staying on top of school work and
reading and things of that nature.

*HV1: And what does she do to help her to _____ _____ ______?

*PAR: Same thing I do: Stress the fact that, “You do your homework, take your ten or 15 minutes to
read and you can go outside and have fun. You want to go outside and have fun? You do your reading.
You don’t understand something? Come sit down and talk to me. We’ll work it out.” That’s the way we
do it.

*HV1: How do you know if she’s doing a good job reading a book?

*PAR: She can tell me the things that I ask. When I go back and I ask her questions, y'know, “What are
these characters like? What’s going on in the story?” and just different things about the books that
she’s reading. If she can tell me what’s going on, then I know that she understands what she’s reading
and she comprehends it.

*HV1: How would you describe her reading skills?

*PAR: I would say she’s above her grade level. I do know that. She has been reading chapter books
since she was in first grade. I started them reading well before even Pre-K and they always come with
these big words. “Where did you learn that?” “Oh, I saw it on this building and I kind of just put it
together.” I’m like, “What building?” “Oh, over there.” I’m like, “You don’t even know how to read.”
“Well, I sounded it out.” “Hmm. Okay, yeah. That works.”

[Laughter]

Both of them always. It just amazes me how much stuff that kids actually know and you don’t
even realize. You look up and they’re talking to you and you’re like, “Where do you get this from?”
Never cease to amaze me.

**Other coded sections from home visit**

*PAR: She reads every day as part of her homework curriculum. I make her read every day. She doesn’t
necessarily have to read for her homework, but she reads every day, at least 15 or 20 minutes every day.
**
*PAR: The Guinness Book of World Records. She likes nonfiction. She’s very inquisitive about the world
and what’s going on around her. She’s always asking me some question or something, and when she
gets those types of book she’s like, “Oh, this is interesting,” and she comes and asks me a million
questions. I’m like, “I don’t know what you’re talking about.”
[Laughter]
“I don’t know who has the biggest head of all time. I don’t know. Look in the book.”
[Laughter]
She likes to ask me questions like that and we’ll go and we’ll be looking in the book. We’ll look it up, and
we’ve been looking at this book for hours. So she likes nonfiction books. Those are her favorite.
**
*PAR: I think once or twice a month because I stay so busy, but I mention, “Did you read your book
today? Have you read? What are you reading?” I don’t necessarily read with her, but I make sure she
stays on top of it. I see progress reports come home and report cards and check their homework and
stuff like that. “Make sure you stay on top of your schoolwork.”
**
*HV1: How often do you take her to the library? Would you say never, hardly ever, once or twice a
month, once or twice a week, almost every day?
*PAR: Hardly ever. With modern technology and the constant buying of books, we don’t need to go to
the library. You can check books out online and put them on the eReader and keep on moving, and she
likes it that way. That way, “I get to play with my new toy.”

*open-ended interview*

HV05: Ok, this was the first part of this activity, for the second one you can keep that slip. The second
part does have questions but they do not have options like these. No multiple options, those are open
questions. Again, there is no right or correct answers. The first question is, we are interest to know what
do you and Child J does in your daily activities? Can you elaborate on this as much as you can remember,
about a typical day of Child J since she wakes up until she goes to bed?

PAR: Since she wakes up, the two of us or just Child J?

[00:11:00.15]

HV05: Just Child J.

PAR: The first thing she does is brushing her teeth, she takes breakfast, and then she watches TV for a
while.

HV05: During the morning.

PAR: Yes during the morning, and then we clean the house, I tell her to clean her room.

HV05: but is that like a typical day when she is attending school or like this time when she is on
vacation?

[00:11:27.09]

PAR: Oh... when she goes to school, when she goes to school she wakes up, she brushes her teeth, she
takes breakfast and then she goes to school.

HV05: uhu

PAR: And then she comes home, she eats, get a shower, and then she reads ten minutes until 8 o ´clock,
that is what she does when she goes to school.

HV05: Ok, we are interested to know about the books that Child J reads and her reading interests, right
now she is showing (Home Visitor) some books, where did she acquire most of those books?

[00:12:08.13]

PAR: In Atlanta, the teacher gave her the books, she was in a program.

HV05: Where?

PAR: In Atlanta, the teacher gave her...

HV05: How in Atlanta, you used to live there?

PAR: We lived in Atlanta, her kindergarden teacher buys her many books, and she gave her books. I
enrolled her in a summer course and there they gave her a lot of books. Also her dad bought her some
books.

[00:12:39.22]

HV05: Ok, what are some of the activities that you do to help her to become a good reader?

PAR: I do not take anywhere, I just here with here. She mostly reads in English, I just listen to hear
because I do not understand English.

[00:13:05.04]

HV05: Ok, what do you do, if you do anything at all, to help her to give her time to read?

PAR: What do I do?

HV05: Yes.

PAR: I first tell her to do all her duties so that she has time to read.

HV05: What do you do to make her understand the meaning of new words?

[00:13:29.06]

PAR: I ask her to explain me the words. Go with your dad because the questions are for Child J. Child K,
Child K, go with your dad because these questions are for Child J, go. Do not come here until I tell you
so.

HV05: He does not understand.

[00:14:00.07]

PAR: He likes a lot being here.

HV05: No, but he obeys.

PAR: Oh yes.

HV05: Immediately.

PAR: If he does not obey I put him against the wall.

Laughter

HV05: Umm... so you help her so that she learns the meaning of new words, what do you do to make
her read better the words?

[00:14:29.28]

PAR: to make her read better the words? Well I...I told you... I do not know.... but I ask her that is the
only thing I can do because I have no way to know if she is reading well, as she is reads in English.

HV05: Oh in English, ok. Do you do anything when your daughter has a hard time reading a book?

[00:15:04.03]

PAR: Something that I do?

HV05: Yes, what do you do?

PAR: Well... If I see that she can´t read the book, I give her an easier one and I tell her to read that one
and then the other one. Next day I tell her to read the book that she could not read and then I tell her
that if she can´t then she must practice more, so that she can read better.

[00:15:31.20]

HV05: What are some of the question that you ask her when you talk her about the books that she
reads?

PAR: I ask her what was the story about; I ask her what she understood about the story. She does not
tell me everything, she just tells me a little.

HV05: What do you do if you do anything at all, to motivate her?

[00:16:03.24]

PAR: I tell her a lot of things; I tell her that she must reads so that she can have a better future. I tell her
that she must study because is for her own benefit. She can do it; she must just do an effort.

[00:16:30.08]

HV05: Are there are any other persons here that help her to read?

PAR: Her sister.

HV05: Her older sister, she is in 5th grade, how old is she?

PAR: 11

HV05: And what does she does to help her Child J?

PAR: She reads with her and explain Child J what she does not understand. She explains her Child J does
not understand.

[00:17:01.13]

HV05: Are there any other person that helps her? Her dad?

PAR: No, her dad is always working. He arrives home and then he goes to sleep.

HV05: How do you know if Child J did well after having read book?

PAR: I know because I ask her, and she tells me that she understood the book.

[00:17:30.21]

HV05: How would you describe her reading skills?

PAR: I think they are ok.

HV05: Which objectives do you have for her reading in this summer?

PAR: What?

HV05: Which objectives do you have for Child J ´s reading in this summer?

[00:18:01.04]

PAR: Objectives, umm... I do not know, I thought to enroll her in a summer program because... I think
that I do not help her a lot because I do not speak English. I read her in Spanish but I feel that is no use
to her, she does not understand.

HV05: Which program it is?

PAR: I was looking for a summer course?

HV05: A school course or camping course?

[00:18:32.10]

PAR: A camping course.

HV05: An activity course.

PAR: For reading and math.

HV05: Oh I see an academic course.

PAR: That was my idea; I was going to look for it.
*Other coded excerpts from home visit*
PAR: She likes a lot reading, so I am listening there, but as I do not understand...
HV05: Oh in English.
PAR: Uhu... I do not understand English, but she reads and she explains me. She likes when I tell her
"Very good, you are a very smart girl" and....things like that. Not just with her, always with the other
four.


01-AQF
*open-ended interview*
*HV1: Okay. And the next set of questions just open ended questions and you just answer them
however. So we’re interested in knowing the kind of things you and your third grader do in your every
day routine. So tell me about a typical day for Child T from morning till bedtime as well as you can
remember.

*PAR: Well, we get up. Child T and her brother catch the bus. I go off to work. Come home.
Sometimes I’m here before they start homework and sometimes I’m not here till after. We normally eat
dinner. They take their baths. They have maybe what a hour or so to theirselves and then it’s bedtime.

*HV1: Okay. So we’re interested in learning more about your child’s books and reading interests. So
Child T is now showing (home visitor) some books. So where did your child get most of his or her books?
And I think you said earlier the school library.

*PAR: School library. And she has bought a few on her own with like allowance money.

*HV1: Okay. But as far as most of them, from the school library.

*PAR: They’re mostly from the school library.

*HV1: Okay. What are some things that you do to help your child become a good reader?

*PAR: She doesn’t have a hard time with reading.

*HV1: Okay. So when she reads she doesn’t –

*PAR: She doesn’t have any questions. When she first started reading she may ask, “Mom, what’s this
word,” or something like that. But she normally doesn’t have any questions ______.

*HV1: Okay. What are some questions that you ask your child when you talk about books that she has
read?

*PAR: I may ask her what she read and what the story was about.

*HV1: Okay. Are there other people in your home that help your child with reading?

*PAR: No. You don’t help her read do you?

PAR 2: [Inaudible Comment]

*HV1: Okay. So how do you know if your child has done a good job reading a book?

*PAR: I don’t. I don’t. I really don’t. Ask her about it as much as I should.

*HV1: Okay. So what makes a good third grade reader? Like just from what you know.

*PAR: Mm. It’s someone that enjoys it.

*HV1: Okay. And what should a good reader be able to do?

*PAR: Tell you in detail about the book.

*HV1: And how would you describe your child’s reading skills?

*PAR: Great.

*HV1: Great. And what goals do you have for your child’s reading this summer?

01-ABI

R10: Oh, ok, umm... I thing that this is the last question that I am going to make to you amongst these,
but before this, as (Home Visitor) and Child J are still talking, I am going to make you another set of
questions, and for this purpose I have the list here. Um, for example, one of the question that we have
here, which is not necessarily related to the questions that I have just asked you, but somehow they are
related. We are interested in what you and Child J (or you and your 3rd degree daughter) in your daily
routines. Tell me please the most that you remember about a typical day of Child J since she wakes up to
bedtime.

[00:09:34.25]

PAR: Typical? How?

R10: Uh yes, the things that you and Child J do in an everyday basis, a normal day, what do you do in a
normal day?

[00:09:42.06]

PAR: Well, in a normal day well uh... lets say, during the week, I wake up, I take them to school, I come
home and begin to make my chores, cooking and at 3:30 pm I go to pick her up, and then she sees TV for
a while I still am doing my activities or cooking, then I make them to take a shower. I then ask her if she
has homework and if she answers me yes then I have her to make her homework, and then we read.
When the night falls I send her to bed, and the next day is the same. And in Saturdays and Sundays, well
uh, we wake up, we go for breakfast, then we go to the "Pulga", that is how we call it, we go for a ride in
la "Pulga", we come home and she goes outside to play bicycle with her friends and then she gets to
home and if she takes a shower if she feels like to. And then she watches TV, this is the day when I do
not order her to read. And then is already 10 o´clock, so it is bedtime.

[00:10:42.28]

R10: Bedtime, yes.

R10: You are busy all day.

PAR: Yeah, and sometimes yes, I do not have enough time to... I have seen many people that go to
parks or go out, but I do not take her out during the week, I remain here in house.

[00:11:02.05]

R10: Doing house chores and activities and homework, and so on, I see. We are also interested in
learning more about the books of your daughter and her reading interests, Child J is right now showing
(Home Visitor) some books, you see how she have been coming from one place to another. Where your
daughter did acquired most of her books?

PAR: In the school.

R10: In the school.

PAR: In book fairs.

[00:11:26.01]

R10: That is what you are telling me about a while ago, right? About the book fairs, and what are some
of the things that you do help her to become a good reader? And again, you may have already talked to
me about this topic.

PAR: Um, I just help her with the reading, sometimes I don´t because I do not speak English very well
but my husband does, so he is who helps her to read. Sometimes we let her alone so that she picks the
book by herself and then tells me that she finished it, she comes with us and we discuss what is wrong
or what is right.

[00:12:07.12]

R10: Uh-huh

PAR: So we correct, though she puts a lot of effort sometimes. As I said to you, she likes reading and
find it interesting because have seen her, just that sometimes the words are very difficult to her.

R10: Yes, the next question is also related to what you have just answered. What do you do when your
daughter is having a hard time reading a book?

[00:12:29.27]

PAR: What we do is for example when there is a large word... I told you, she gathers the words and goes
pronouncing the sounds. We tell her that by uniting all the words she is going to find the answer. We
she can´t do it, we provide her the answer. But we have her to write the words in a notebook, in a sheet,
so she begins to remember. Next day when we ask her about the word, she answers. This is like a
punishment but I think that I do it because that is the only way she can encourage herself to remember
the word, and that is how she proceeds, when she makes an error, the word is added to the notebook.

[00:13:16.04]

R10: And do you parents do this all the time.

PAR: Every time that she reads during the week, which is always.

R10: And where did you learn that technique?

[00:13:29.06]

PAR: They taught me that in the school, the "five finger technique", so there was times when... in the
school they told me "Look, put her to read and if she has two or three mistakes that is because she only
has two fingers, that is a very easy book for her". But they told me "If she pass from five fingers, the
book is hard for her." So that is the way the taught me. And the word thing in the notebook was an idea
that I and my husband came with, so they can learn.

[00:14:02.29]

R10: What are some of the question that your daughter asks to you when she talks about the books
that she has read?

PAR: I ask her question such as what was the story about, who was the author, which was the conflict
and how did they solve it. Um, when it is not about a conflict and is about... like... there was a book
about a mom who went every Saturday to make up her room, and I ask my daughter in whom days did
the mom make the room, what the mom did, and my daughter answers me. But regularly the questions
are about what was it about, who was the main character of the story, who was in the story, the names,
the conflict, how it was solved?

[00:14:42.24]

R10: And, does Child J ask you questions? Um, about the books that she has read?

PAR: Yes, she tells me sometimes "I did read this one and I had this problem, what do you think it
happened?" And she answers herself.

[00:15:08.08]

R10: Oh ok.

PAR: So asks me the questions about what was the story about.

R10: And what do you do to encourage Child J to read? That is if you do anything to.

[00:15:18.25]

PAR: The only thing I can tell you is that we have now another strategy because we used to have many
arguments because the two of them have a lot of reading problems. I was not seeing any progress and
we would put her with the notebook words but still no progress, so what I try to do so she can make an
effort in reading is telling her that I am going to giving a present or something, I have not bought her a
lot of things but a little present so that they can convince themselves that if they do well they will
receive a present from me.

R10: To reward one´s effort.

PAR: Yeah, to reward their effort, ok. Well, would you let me... um, I don´t if Child J and Erika already
finished?

R08: She is still reading.

[00:16:00.22]

R10: Oh she is reading, ok then I will ask you another question, umm, are there other person in your
house that help your daughter and what they do to help her? I know that you already told me about
your husband.

PAR: Well, we are just my husband and I who put them to read, but long time ago, the one who helped
a lot was my sister-in-law but she is not here anymore, so since the year that my daughter begun school,
I have been who has helped them, but mostly my husband, who has been in charge of the reading.

[00:16:34.19]

R10: How do you know...umm, and I am back to the conversation, how do you know if your daughter
has performed a good job reading a book?

PAR: Hmm, I know because they have told me in the school which book is difficult for my daughter
when I go to ask about it, they tell me that she has completed a level, so that is when I see that the
things we taught her have been proven to be useful for her, And most of all, we she starts to read a
book that is hard to her, it is noticeable that is hard for her, so some days after when we put her to read
she reads it without difficulties, so we realize that she has improved in reading.

[00:17:18.05]

R10: And just as I told you, there is no right or wrong answers for these questions; umm....what makes a
third grade student a good reader? What is capable...what to do a good reader?

[00:17:33.20]

PAR: Well, you see... umm, you see.... now since I have helped her since third degree, they tell me in the
school that she has to read like this (SHOWING THICKNESS WITH FINGERS).

R10: Oh okay.

PAR: With no drawings.

R10: And when she shows together her two fingers is like....two inches approximately.

PAR: Yeah it is.

R10: 2 inches width, that is the book´s width.

PAR: I see the book and I thing that "That is a lot, my daughter won´t learn that much, that is a lot" and
as I have told you, she have been a little below as for reading. But they tell that she is capable of doing it
and I say "I will try" The books that she brings here are this width (shows width) a little width, but they
contain a lot of letters.

[00:18:11.26]

R10: If they are slim they are like half an inch, right? That is what you are showing to me, half an inch.

PAR: Look approximately half an inch.

R10: half an inch.

PAR: There are ones that.... the last time she brought one, it was like this, like more than an inch.

R10: One inch, I am trying to calculate it with my fingers (laughter)

PAR: Yeah but she did read it. She took some time to, I won´t lie to you about it, but she took a lot of
time with that book.

[00:18:31.18]

R10: Yes, it was like a success for her, an achievement, and right?

PAR: Yes but in order to her to become a good reader, she must read a book making no interruptions or
anything, a big book, that is what they told me at school.

R10: Good, I am seeing that they are almost finishing. How would you describe the reading skills of Child
J now?

PAR: I sense that she is doing fine, working hard... um, she has a lot of will to learn, because I have seen
her.

[00:19:02.10]

R10: And the last question that I have here is: What objectives do you have for Child J ´s reading for this
summer?

R10: Well I...my objective for this summer with her am that she becomes capable to read a lot of books.

R10: Ok.

[00:19:23.14]

PAR: To improve her reading, so that if she enters to fourth grade, she enters without that difficulty
because when she sees that she is not doing well, she demoralize herself.

R10: She gets demoralized.

PAR: She gets depressed, so this is what I think, I would like to put her in summer school but there are
no places left.

R10: There is no place left in there. I have here... when I came here, you told me that... that you had go
to the office of...to the new place where you are moving, when you are changing house, will they change
school too, or they will still attend the same school?

[00:20:10.24]

PAR: In fact when I moved to here a school change was required.

R10: Uh-huh

PAR: But I do not want to change her, because they like it and I also like the way they teach. I still think
that I do not want to change her from there.

[00:20:29.14]

R10: But when changing address, is she required to get changed from school or still can she attending
the same school?

PAR: She can still attend the same school provided that I bring her there and pick her up back home.

R10: Right, we just wanted to make sure if she was still attending the same school, and also, if she was
going to change school, we wanted to know which school would go to be, in this case she attends....

PAR: Inaudible

[00:20:51.29]

R10: (Indiscernible) , right. This is because we wanted to know if she was going to remain in that school
or any other. I have a list of schools, she was not going to another school because now if she changes to
another school that we do not have included in the program, then we can´t come back to interview you.

PAR: No, she is going to still attend that school this year. If I decide to, she is going to remain in that
school.

*other excerpts from home visit*
PAR: And I only read her, I mean I only regularly let her to read just one book, if the book is very hard, I
give her the book for all week so that she can understand the book.


01-BFO
HV1: The first question is… We are interested to know what you and Child J do on your daily routines.
Tell us please as much as you can remember how is a typical day for Child J, from the moment he wakes
up until the moment he goes back to bed.
PAR: Okay. Since he wakes up, he… He gets up, goes to the bathroom, he takes a bath, he brushes his
teeth, he has some light breakfast, a glass of juice, or something else, and he goes to school. He comes
back to school, arrives home, and the little problem he has is that he loves TV. He loves TV, and he is so
addicted to it that when I ask him if he already did his homework, he answers “yes”… Many times he has
said “yes” to my question, and then when I wanted to check, it wasn’t true. He had told me “yes”
because he was watching TV. Okay… We go to church. We go, we come back. Then, sometimes he
studies, reads the Bible, I’m not sure if he reads a book.
HV1: But going to the church, is that every day? Is that a daily routine?
PAR: We do it five times a week.
HV1: Ah, ok.
PAR: Five times a week. Before going to church we have dinner, he has done his homework. We come
back, and then I tell him to read something, even if it’s just five minutes. He does, and then we all go to
sleep. And sometimes, I tell him… When we are all practically in bed, and all lights are off, everyone in
their rooms, and I sometimes have to go out and do something, I go out I find him sitting, watching TV.
That is the little problem I have.
HV1: We are also interested in learning what kind of books… Child J’s books and his reading interests.
Child J has some books at the moment. Where did Child J get most of those books?
PAR: In the… In the… (clicks fingers) In the “Goodwills”, you know? These second-hand stores. I’ve
bought books for him there. And also in “Wallart” (?), when we go there.
HV1: “Goodwill” is the donations store.
PAR: Yes. There.
HV1: And “Wallart” (?). (Long silence) You… Do some of those books come from the public library or the
school library? No…?
PAR: Sometimes he brings books from school. Yes, they give him books at school to bring home.
HV1: Okay. What do you do to help him become a good reader?
PAR: Really, I think nothing. The only thing is when I tell him to read, but… That’s the only thing.
HV1: You can’t say anything else on the matter?
PAR: No, it’s just… To be honest, I don’t feel like I’m helping him for him to sort of… Improve in reading.
The only thing that I do is tell him to read, but really, we hardly share… I only ask him about what he
read, and he tells me, but… Nothing more.
HV1: Is there anybody else at home that helps him read?

PAR: The older sisters.
HV1: All older sisters?
PAR: Both of them.
HV1: How old are they?
PAR: Twelve and eleven.
HV1: Twelve and eleven. And what do they do to help him?
PAR: They read all together in a group, but… (Laughs) Just that.
HV1: You don’t know.
PAR: No.
HV1: Okay.
PAR: To be honest, I’m not very involved in that.
HV1: (Rustling sounds) How do you know if Child J did a good job reading a book?
PAR: Mmm… I cannot say, because when he reads a book, even if I want to see what it is about, I don’t
understand, so… I just ask him what the story was about and what the book was like, and he tells me,
but nothing else.
HV1: How would you describe Child J’s reading skills?
PAR: Lately, in this last month and a half, or the last month, it has improved significantly. Because I have
told him to read more, and yesterday I had a meeting with his teacher and she told me that he had
improved, that he was in G level and now he had risen to level M.
HV1: What are those levels?
PAR: Like in the alphabet, I guess it is.
HV1: Ah, okay.
PAR: Like, G… E, F, G, H, I, J, K, M. So he increased 9 levels from what he had.
HV1: And that was… This last month, you say.
PAR: Uh-huh. Around a month and a half. He was in that level. G. And he passed to level M. He has
improved quite a bit in reading.
HV1: What goals do you have for Child J’s reading this summer?
PAR: To be honest… Reading is very, very important, something that I hadn’t paid enough attention to
before, and I want him to improve his level. He has to be on M level, that is his grade. I want him to be
on his right level, not behind on the reading level.
HV1: Okay. This ended the second part of the conversation.
